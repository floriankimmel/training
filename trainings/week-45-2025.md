- **Oct 28 (Day 2)**: 48.09ms (Good - rising trend begins) ✓
- **Oct 29 (Day 3)**: 48.55ms (Good - stable recovery) ✓
- **Oct 30 (Day 4)**: 56.35ms (GOOD - strong rebound, 16% above baseline!) ✓✓
- **Oct 31 (Day 5)**: 39.21ms (Low - concerning drop after excellent Day 4) ⚠️
- **Nov 1 (Day 6)**: 35.02ms (LOW - continued decline, 11% below baseline) ⚠️⚠️

**Baseline Context**: Good = 47-53ms | Moderate = 41-47ms | Low = <41ms

**Analysis**:
- Days 1-4 showed **textbook recovery** pattern (initial drop → progressive rise → strong rebound)
- Days 5-6 show **concerning reversal** - dropped from 56.35ms to 35.02ms (37% decline)
- **Possible factors**: Oct 30 sleep disruption (242min awake!), accumulated fatigue, training stress
- **Pattern**: Not illness/overtraining (RHR stable), likely sleep-related recovery compromise

**Resting Heart Rate (RHR) Trend**:
- **Oct 24-25 (Pre-Race)**: 52-54 bpm (EXCELLENT - lowest values, peak freshness)
- **Oct 26 (Race Morning)**: 63 bpm (Elevated - pre-race/post-race expected)

- **Oct 31-Nov 1 (Day 5-6)**: 380min/6.3h (Moderate - 104min REM, 66min deep)
- **Nov 1-2 (Day 6-7)**: 383min/6.4h (Moderate - 91min REM, 70min deep)

**Baseline Context**: Good = 420-480min (7-8h) | Moderate = 360-420min (6-7h) | Short = <360min

**Analysis**:
- **Critical finding**: Oct 29-30 and Oct 30-31 nights had **extreme disruption** (242min + 173min awake)
- Deep sleep compromised Oct 26-27 (38min post-race) and Oct 28-29 (31min)
- Sleep duration below 7h every night of recovery week (vs 7-8h baseline)
- **This explains HRV drops** on Oct 31-Nov 1 (35-39ms) - insufficient sleep quality

### Recovery Assessment: Yellow Light → Green Light Transitioning

**🟡 Yellow Indicators (Oct 31 - Nov 1)**:
- HRV dropped to 35-39ms (below 41ms baseline threshold)
- Sleep quality significantly compromised (242min + 173min awake nights)
- Deep sleep deficits on multiple nights
- Total sleep duration below baseline (6.3-6.7h vs 7-8h target)

**🟢 Green Indicators (Current)**:
- ✅ RHR stable at 55 bpm (normal baseline) - no cardiovascular stress
- ✅ Subjective feedback improving (Day 3: 7/10 → Day 4: 6/10 with better legs)
- ✅ Running execution excellent (perfect HR control 138-143 bpm)
- ✅ HRV showed strong Day 4 rebound (56.35ms) before sleep-related drop
- ✅ No signs of overtraining, illness, or injury
- ✅ 7 days post-race = appropriate recovery timeline for 10K effort

**Recovery Status**: **GREEN LIGHT for Week 45 training start**
- Physical recovery: COMPLETE (RHR normal, running feels good, legs recovering well)
- Sleep: Needs monitoring but improving
- HRV: Will rebound with better sleep (Day 4 showed 56.35ms capacity)
- Readiness: Ready for conservative base building with close monitoring

### Week 44 Performance Validation

**Training Plan Predicted**:
- Week 44 recovery: Complete rest Mon-Wed, optional easy Thu-Fri, light strength work
- **Actual execution**: Conservative approach followed - appropriate for post-race recovery

**Race Performance Highlights**:
- Pre-race metrics were PERFECT: HRV 60.35ms (peak), RHR 52-54 bpm (lowest values)
- Race execution was TEXTBOOK: 172.6 bpm avg, negative split, 714W peak power
- Post-race recovery generally good but sleep quality needs attention

## Trail Training Transition Context

### From 10K Racing to 34K Trail Ultra

**What Changed in Week 45:**
You're transitioning from **10K cross-country racing** (50min, Z4 intensity) to **34K trail ultra training** (3-4 hour, Z2-Z3 intensity). This requires fundamental shifts:

**Distance**: 10km → 34km (3.4x longer) - Need time on feet, not speed
**Duration**: 50 minutes → 3-4 hours - Aerobic endurance base priority
**Elevation**: 200m → 1000m+ - Sustained climbing power vs. short hill bursts
**Intensity**: Z4 race pace → Z2-Z3 sustained - Lower intensity, longer duration
**Energy**: No fueling → Mandatory nutrition - Must train gut and fueling strategy
**Pacing**: Fast throughout → Conservative management - Patience over speed
**Recovery**: 7-10 days → 14-21 days - Longer efforts require more recovery

### Training Philosophy Shift

**Old Focus** (Weeks 35-44): Speed, threshold, hill power, race-pace intervals
**New Focus** (Weeks 45-64): Volume, time on feet, sustained efforts, climbing endurance

**Key Adaptation Period** (Weeks 45-48, 4 weeks):
- Rebuild weekly volume from post-race low (2-3 hours → 4-5 hours)
- Establish true easy pace discipline (Z1-Z2 majority of training)
- Reintroduce structured workouts gradually
- Build mental comfort with longer efforts

---

## Week 45 Daily Training Plan

### Philosophy: Base Building Week 1
Conservative return to structured training with immediate trail-specific elements. Your excellent race fitness provides foundation, but must respect:
- **7 days post-race** = minimum recovery complete but not full adaptation
- **Sleep deficit pattern** = close monitoring of recovery metrics needed
- **Trail transition** = introduce longer, easier efforts vs. 10K intensity focus
- **Volume rebuild** = 10-15% increase from recovery week (~2.5-3h total target)

---

## Monday, November 3

- **Lunch**: **Base Building Easy Run** - 45 minutes @ Z1-Z2 (120-154 bpm)

---

## Backup Options for Busy/Missed Sessions

**Missed Tuesday Hill Intervals:**
- Reduced volume: 3x3min uphill @ Z3-Z4 with 2-3min recovery (40 min total)
- Flat alternative: 4x4min @ Z3-Z4 on any terrain with 2min recovery (acceptable but less ideal)
- Treadmill option: 4x3min @ 3-4% grade, Z3-Z4 effort

**Missed Thursday Sustained Tempo:**
- Alternative: 4x5min @ Z3 with 90s recovery on any terrain
- Reduced tempo: 15min sustained Z3 on rolling terrain (maintain quality, reduce volume)
- Bridge workout: 3x6min @ Z3 with 2min recovery

**Time Constraints:**
- **Priority session**: Thursday sustained tempo (trail-specific threshold building)
- **Minimum effective dose**: 15min sustained Z3 effort on any terrain (35 min total session)
- Can reduce Tuesday to 3x2.5min hill efforts if time critical (but maintain hill terrain)

**If Sleep Quality Poor:**
- Replace Tuesday intervals with 40min easy run @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
- Reduce Thursday tempo to 40min easy run @ Z1-Z2
- Prioritize sleep recovery over training stimulus

---

## Weekly Targets & Progression

**Volume Targets**:
- **Total running time**: 155-175 minutes (2.6-2.9 hours)
- **Breakdown**: 45min + 50min + 40min + 50min weekday = 185min structured + optional weekend
- **Progression**: +50-75min vs. Week 44 recovery week (2 hours → 2.6-2.9 hours)
- **Trail Context**: First step toward peak volume of 6-7 hours (Weeks 9-11 of 2026)

**Quality Sessions**:
- **2 main sessions**: Tuesday hills (4x3min) + Thursday tempo (20min)
- **Focus**: Moderate volume intensity to assess post-race fitness retention
- **Intensity distribution**: ~30 minutes quality work + 145-155 minutes easy running
- **Trail adaptation**: Quality work = sustained efforts, not race-pace speed

**Easy Running Emphasis**:
- **125-145 minutes easy** across Mon/Wed/Fri/optional weekend (80% of total volume)
- **Target HR**: 130-145 bpm average (true Z1-Z2 discipline)
- **Purpose**: Build aerobic base for 3-4 hour race efforts (this is 80% of trail training)
- **Mental shift**: Easy running is NOT junk miles - it's the trail ultra foundation

**Strength Training**:
- **2-3 sessions** of 25 minutes each (50-75 minutes total)
- **Focus**: Trail-specific functional strength (single-leg stability, glutes, core, proprioception)
- **Tuesday-Friday only** (never Monday evenings per preference)
- **Flexible**: Can skip if recovery metrics poor or training load high

## Detailed Workout Execution Guidance

### Tuesday Hill Intervals (4x3min @ Z3-Z4 on 2-3% grade)

**Post-Race Context**:
- **Previous hill work**: Week 42-43: 4x3min @ 374-345W, 159-166 bpm
- **Race performance**: 297W avg climbing power, 714W max - climbing fitness confirmed
- **Assessment goal**: Validate fitness retention 7-9 days post-race

**Execution Strategy**:
- **Find proper terrain**: MUST be 2-3% gradient for 3-minute climb (avoid Week 41 flat terrain error)
- **Warm-up focus**: Extra time to activate legs after recovery week (12 min vs. typical 10 min)
- **Rep 1**: 160-165 bpm - Conservative start, assess post-race leg response
- **Rep 2**: 162-167 bpm - Build confidence, find climbing rhythm
- **Rep 3**: 165-170 bpm - Demonstrate fitness, push controlled
- **Rep 4**: 165-172 bpm - Finish strong, prove depth retained
- **Power expectation**: 280-320W (slightly conservative vs. race prep 374W, but trail-relevant)
- **Recovery protocol**: FULL 2-3 minutes walk/easy jog - prioritize quality over speed
- **Form cues**: Shorter steps on climbs, 83-87 rpm cadence, strong arm drive

**Success Metrics**:
- Complete all 4 reps with controlled breathing
- Power >280W average per interval
- HR 160-172 bpm sustained across reps
- No unusual fatigue or form breakdown
- Comparable feel to pre-race sessions

**Trail Relevance**:
- Lindkogel requires 1000m+ climbing over 34km
- These intervals build sustained climbing power (not sprint power)
- 3-minute efforts = similar to continuous race uphills
- Target power (280-320W) = sustainable for hours vs. race max (714W) = short bursts

### Thursday Sustained Tempo (20min @ Z3, 154-165 bpm)

**Post-Race Context**:
- **Previous tempo**: Week 42: 15min @ 152.8 bpm (under target), Week 41: 20min @ 161.7 bpm (PERFECT)
- **Race execution**: 172.6 bpm avg over 50 minutes - proves Z3 capacity strong
- **Assessment goal**: Confirm threshold fitness after recovery week

**Execution Strategy**:
- **Terrain selection**: Rolling with 50-100m total elevation (less than race prep's hills)
- **Start discipline**: Begin at 158 bpm (learn from Week 42's conservative 152.8 bpm start)
- **Minutes 1-5**: Settle into 158-162 bpm range (middle of Z3, comfortable entry)
- **Minutes 6-15**: Hold 160-165 bpm across terrain (use flats to recover, climbs to push)
- **Minutes 16-20**: Allow 162-168 bpm if feeling strong (demonstrate depth)
- **Effort cue**: "Comfortably challenging conversation" - could speak 2-3 words, not sentences
- **Breathing**: Rhythmic and controlled - NOT gasping like race pace
- **Mental focus**: "This is my RACE PACE for 3-4 hours" - practice sustainable Z3 effort

**Success Metrics**:
- 20 minutes average 158-165 bpm (Z3 middle range)
- Maintain effort across terrain changes (no panic on climbs, no coasting on descents)
- Power 270-290W sustained (aerobic threshold, not lactate threshold)
- Controlled breathing throughout - should feel challenging but NOT like intervals
- Finish feeling "I could continue longer at this effort"

**Trail Relevance**:
- 34km race will require 3-4 hours of sustained Z2-Z3 effort
- Uphills will be Z3-Z4, flats/downhills will be Z2-Z3 recovery
- This tempo teaches "sustainable hard" effort (vs. 10K "unsustainable hard")
- Mental practice for effort management over hours, not minutes

### Monday & Wednesday Easy Runs (45min & 40min @ Z1-Z2)

**Critical for Trail Success**:
- **80% of trail training** is easy running (vs. 60% for 10K training)
- **Aerobic base** for 3-4 hour efforts comes from VOLUME of easy miles
- **Active recovery** between quality sessions allows consistent training
- **Mental practice** for patient pacing (start of 34km race MUST feel this easy)

**Execution Checklist**:
- **HR discipline**: 130-145 bpm target (learn from Week 44's 138-143 bpm execution)
- **Start protocol**: First 5 minutes at 125-135 bpm to set tone
- **HR checks**: Every 5 minutes verify staying below 150 bpm
- **Pace acceptance**: 5:30-6:30 min/km is PERFECT for this intensity
- **Terrain**: Primarily flat with gentle rolling only
- **Conversation test**: Should be able to speak full sentences easily
- **Mental cue**: "Banking aerobic miles" - this builds fitness for long efforts

**Common Errors to Avoid**:
- Running at 150+ bpm "because it feels easy" (drift upward)
- Chasing pace instead of HR (ego driven, not aerobic benefit)
- Getting frustrated with "slow" pace (this IS the correct pace)
- Comparing to race pace (completely different training zone and purpose)

## Recovery Monitoring & Adaptation Protocol

### Daily Recovery Checks

**Morning Assessment** (before eating/moving):
1. **HRV (if tracked)**: Compare to baseline (Good: 47-53ms, Moderate: 41-47ms, Low: <41ms)
2. **RHR**: Compare to baseline (Good: 54-57 bpm, Elevated: 58-59 bpm, High: >59 bpm)
3. **Sleep quality**: Duration (target 7-8h) + subjective feel (restful vs. disrupted)
4. **Subjective feel**: Energy level, leg heaviness, mood, motivation

**During Workout Assessment**:
1. **Warm-up feel**: Do legs feel responsive or heavy?
2. **HR response**: Is HR normal for effort or elevated/depressed?
3. **Breathing**: Is breathing pattern typical or labored?
4. **Form**: Is turnover smooth or feeling sluggish?

**Post-Workout Assessment**:
1. **Recovery HR drop**: Does HR drop quickly (<2 min to Z1) or stay elevated?
2. **Fatigue level**: Normal post-workout tiredness vs. excessive fatigue?
3. **Next-day feel**: Legs sore but responsive vs. heavy and unresponsive?

### Adaptation Decision Matrix

**🟢 GREEN LIGHT - Proceed as Planned**:
- HRV: Good range (47-53ms) OR improving trend
- RHR: Baseline range (54-57 bpm) OR stable
- Sleep: 7+ hours with good quality
- Subjective: Good energy, responsive legs, motivated
- **Action**: Execute training plan as written

**🟡 YELLOW LIGHT - Modify Training**:
- HRV: Moderate range (41-47ms) OR declining trend over 2+ days
- RHR: Elevated (58-59 bpm) OR rising 3+ bpm above baseline
- Sleep: <7 hours OR poor quality 2+ nights
- Subjective: Low energy, slight leg heaviness, reduced motivation
- **Action**:
  - Replace Tuesday intervals with 40min easy @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
  - Reduce Thursday tempo to 40min easy @ Z1-Z2 (120-154 bpm)
  - Skip strength training this week
  - Prioritize sleep and nutrition

**🔴 RED LIGHT - Extra Rest Needed**:
- HRV: Low (<41ms) for 3+ consecutive days
- RHR: High (>59 bpm) sustained OR >5 bpm above baseline
- Sleep: Severely disrupted multiple nights OR <6 hours consistently
- Subjective: Persistent fatigue, heavy legs, poor motivation, feeling unwell
- **Action**:
  - Cancel all quality sessions (Tuesday intervals, Thursday tempo)
  - Replace with 30min easy walks or complete rest
  - Consider medical consultation if symptoms persist >1 week
  - Focus exclusively on sleep, nutrition, stress management

### Week 44 Sleep Disruption Follow-up

**Known Issue**: Oct 29-30 and Oct 30-31 nights had extreme disruption (242min + 173min awake)
**Impact**: HRV dropped to 35-39ms (Low range) on Oct 31 - Nov 1
**Current Status**: Needs monitoring - single poor night is OK, pattern is concerning

**This Week's Focus**:
- **Sleep priority**: 8+ hours target every night
- **Bedtime consistency**: Same time each night (supports circadian rhythm)
- **Sleep hygiene**: Dark room, cool temp, no screens 1h before bed
- **If disruption continues**: Consider sleep specialist consultation
- **Training adjustment**: Use Yellow/Red Light protocols if sleep doesn't improve

## Nutrition & Fueling Transition

### Trail Ultra Nutrition Principles (New for You!)

**10K Racing** (your previous focus):
- **No fueling during race** - glycogen stores sufficient for 50 minutes
- **Pre-race meal** 2-3h before - simple carbs
- **Post-race recovery** - quick carbs + protein within 30min

**34K Trail Ultra** (your new challenge):
- **Mandatory during-race fueling** - glycogen depletes after 90-120min
- **Pre-race meal** timing unchanged but larger carb load needed
- **During race**: 60-90g carbs per hour starting at 30-45 minute mark
- **Post-race recovery** more critical - longer depletion period

### Week 45 Nutrition Focus

**Daily Baseline** (support training + recovery):
- **Protein**: 25-30g per meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) for recovery
- **Carbs**: Adequate for training load - don't restrict (you're building volume)
- **Hydration**: 2-3L water daily (more on training days)
- **Sleep support**: Avoid heavy meals 3h before bed, consistent timing

**Training Day Fueling**:
- **Pre-workout** (1-2h before): Light carb snack (banana, toast with honey)
- **During workout**:
  - <60min: Water only
  - 60-90min: Consider 30g carbs (start practicing for long runs)
  - >90min: 60g carbs per hour (will apply to future long runs)
- **Post-workout**: 30g carbs + 20g protein within 30-60min

**Gut Training** (Critical for Trail Racing!):
- **Purpose**: Train stomach to process food while running (race will require this)
- **Start now**: Week 45 workouts are too short, but practice post-workout fueling
- **Build gradually**: Future long runs (90min+) will require during-run nutrition practice
- **Common foods**: Gels, energy chews, bars, real food (banana, dates) - test to find what works

**Anti-Inflammatory Focus** (support recovery):
- **Include daily**: Berries, leafy greens, fatty fish, nuts, turmeric, ginger
- **Purpose**: Reduce training inflammation, support adaptation
- **Especially important**: Post-quality sessions (Tuesday, Thursday)

## Mental Transition & Race Mindset

### From 10K Racer to Trail Ultra Runner

**Old Identity** (Weeks 35-44):
- "How fast can I run 10km?"
- Success = beating the clock, PRs, race pace execution
- Training = intervals, tempo, threshold work
- Mental challenge = holding intense effort 50 minutes

**New Identity** (Weeks 45-64):
- "How far can I run strong and happy?"
- Success = completing distance healthy, managing effort, enjoying journey
- Training = volume, time on feet, sustainable efforts
- Mental challenge = staying patient 3-4 hours, managing energy, problem-solving

### Week 45 Mental Skills Practice

**Easy Run Patience**:
- **Challenge**: Running 6:00-6:30 min/km when you can run 5:00 min/km
- **Practice**: Mon/Wed/Fri easy runs at 130-145 bpm (will feel "too slow")
- **Mental cue**: "Slower now = faster at 30km" (banking energy for long efforts)
- **Success**: Finishing easy runs feeling refreshed, not tired

**Effort-Based Pacing** (not pace-based):
- **Challenge**: Accepting pace varies with terrain (hills slow you down, that's OK!)
- **Practice**: Thursday tempo maintaining 158-165 bpm despite pace changes
- **Mental cue**: "Consistent effort, variable pace" (race strategy for hills)
- **Success**: Steady breathing across terrain, not chasing pace numbers

**Long-Term Process**:
- **Challenge**: Training for race 20 weeks away (vs. 8-12 weeks for 10K)
- **Practice**: Each week builds foundation for next, patience required
- **Mental cue**: "Trust the process" - adaptations accumulate over months
- **Success**: Enjoying training for itself, not just countdown to race

## Coach's Final Notes for Week 45

Florian,

**OUTSTANDING RACE PERFORMANCE** on October 26! Your 50:31 for 10.18km with 200m elevation was textbook execution:
- Perfect pre-race readiness (HRV 60.35ms, RHR 52-54 bpm)
- Conservative start → progressive build → strong finish (172.6 bpm avg, 178 bpm finish)
- Excellent climbing strength (297W avg, 714W max)
- Negative split pacing strategy executed perfectly

Week 44 recovery was **generally excellent** with appropriate caution. Your Week 44 Thursday run (Day 4 post-race) at 143 bpm showed perfect HR discipline and progressive recovery.

**⚠️ Sleep Quality Concern** (Oct 29-31):
- Two nights with extreme disruption (242min + 173min awake)
- This caused HRV drops to 35-39ms (Low range) on Oct 31 - Nov 1
- RHR stayed stable (55 bpm) = NOT overtraining, likely sleep-specific issue
- **Monitor closely** this week - use Yellow/Red Light protocols if sleep doesn't improve

**Welcome to Trail Ultra Training!**

You're now embarking on a 20-week journey from **10K racer to 34K trail ultra runner**. This is exciting and challenging:

**Key Mental Shifts**:
1. **Slow down to speed up**: 80% of training is easy Z1-Z2 running (vs. 10K's 60%)
2. **Time on feet > race pace**: Building endurance for 3-4 hours, not 50 minutes
3. **Patience is fitness**: Lindkogel requires sustained effort management, not speed
4. **Volume builds gradually**: 20 weeks allows proper adaptation without rushing

**Week 45 Priorities**:
1. **Easy pace discipline**: Practice 130-145 bpm on Mon/Wed easy runs (this is critical!)
2. **Quality assessment**: Tuesday hills + Thursday tempo validate post-race fitness retention
3. **Sleep prioritization**: 8+ hours nightly to prevent Week 44 disruption pattern
4. **Trail mindset**: Start thinking "time on feet" instead of "race pace"

**Your Strengths for Trail Success**:
- **Proven climbing power**: 297-714W range shows you can handle sustained + explosive climbs
- **Zone discipline**: Week 44 showed excellent 138-143 bpm easy run execution (carry this forward!)
- **Race execution**: Your negative split strategy shows patience (key trait for ultra success)
- **Consistency**: 8-week 10K buildup shows you can maintain training discipline

**Trust the Process**:
- Week 45 might feel "too easy" - that's by design (rebuilding post-race, establishing trail base)
- Long runs will come (starting Week 46-47 with 60-90min efforts)
- Hill work transitions from "race pace bursts" to "sustained climbing power"
- By March 2026, you'll look back amazed at the progression

**This Week: Listen to Your Body**
- If sleep remains poor: Use Yellow/Red Light protocols (easy runs only)
- If recovery metrics good: Execute plan as written (4x3min hills, 20min tempo)
- If anything feels off: Extra rest day never hurts (20 weeks allows flexibility)

**You completed an excellent 10K buildup culminating in a perfect race. Now you're building toward something even bigger. Let's start this journey with patience, discipline, and excitement for the adventure ahead!**

See you on the trails! 🏃‍♂️⛰️

## Heart Rate Zone Quick Reference

- **Z1**: 120-146 bpm (Recovery/Easy) - TARGET: 130-140 bpm for easy runs
- **Z2**: 146-154 bpm (Aerobic Base) - TARGET: 145-150 bpm for moderate easy runs
- **Z3**: 154-165 bpm (Tempo/Threshold) - TARGET: 158-165 bpm for tempo work
- **Z4**: 165-174 bpm (Lactate Threshold) - TARGET: 165-172 bpm for hill intervals
- **Z5**: 174-180 bpm (VO2 Max) - Not used in base building phase

**Trail Training Distribution** (80/15/5 Rule):
- **80%** = Z1-Z2 (easy running, foundation building)
- **15%** = Z3 (tempo work, sustained climbing efforts)
- **5%** = Z4+ (hill intervals, race-specific intensity)

**Compare to 10K Training** (60/30/10 Rule):
- **60%** = Z1-Z2 (easy running)
- **30%** = Z3-Z4 (tempo + intervals)
- **10%** = Z5 (VO2max work, race pace)

→ Notice: Trail training is EASIER overall but LONGER duration

## Appendix: Recovery Metrics Tracking Template

Track daily to monitor adaptation and prevent overtraining:

| Date | HRV (ms) | RHR (bpm) | Sleep (min) | Deep (min) | REM (min) | Feel (1-10) | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Mon Nov 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Easy run 45min |
| Tue Nov 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Hill intervals 4x3min |
| Wed Nov 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Easy run 40min |
| Thu Nov 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Tempo run 20min |
| Fri Nov 7 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Rest day |
| Sat Nov 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Optional |
| Sun Nov 9 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Optional |

**Interpretation Guide**:
- **HRV trending up** = good adaptation
- **RHR trending down** = good recovery
- **Sleep 420+ min (7h+)** = adequate for training load
- **Feel improving** = training load appropriate

**Warning Signs**:
- **HRV <41ms for 2+ days** = reduce training intensity
- **RHR >59 bpm sustained** = extra rest needed
- **Sleep <360min (<6h) repeatedly** = sleep intervention needed
- **Feel declining 3+ days** = training load too high
