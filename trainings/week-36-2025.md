# Week 36, 2025 Training Plan

## Week 35 Review & Analysis
- **Plan Structure**: 3 lunch runs (135 min), 3 strength sessions established
- **Quality Focus**: Single tempo session (25 min @ Z3) was appropriate for foundation building
- **Volume**: Conservative approach with 45-40-50 min runs fit lunch break constraints well
- **Progression Ready**: Foundation week completed, ready for structured interval introduction

## Weekly Focus
**Introducing structured intervals while maintaining aerobic base** - Building on Week 35's tempo foundation with more specific lactate threshold work and maintaining strong aerobic development.

---

## Monday

- **Lunch**: Rest from running
- **Evening**: Free (no planned activities)

*Start week fresh - use Monday for mental preparation and full recovery*

## Tuesday

- **Lunch**: Easy run - 45 minutes conversational pace (Z1-Z2: 120-154 bpm)
- **Evening**: Functional strength training - 25 minutes
  - Focus: Core stability, hip strength, single-leg balance
  - Include: Planks, bird dogs, clamshells, single-leg squats

*Aerobic base maintenance - should feel comfortable and relaxed throughout*

## Wednesday

- **Lunch**: Interval session - 50 minutes total
  - 10 min warm-up (Z1: 120-146 bpm)
  - **Main set**: 6 x 3 minutes @ Z4 (165-174 bpm)
    - 90 seconds easy recovery between intervals (Z1-Z2)
  - 10 min cool-down (Z1: 120-146 bpm)
- **Evening**: Free (recovery priority after quality session)

*Key quality session - controlled effort, focus on consistent pacing across intervals*

## Thursday

- **Lunch**: Easy run - 40 minutes conversational pace (Z1-Z2: 120-154 bpm)
- **Evening**: Functional strength training - 25 minutes
  - Focus: Running-specific power and stability
  - Include: Squats, lunges, calf raises, glute bridges

*Active recovery pace - legs should feel refreshed after yesterday's intervals*

## Friday

- **Lunch**: Tempo run - 45 minutes total
  - 10 min warm-up (Z1: 120-146 bpm)
  - 20 min steady tempo (Z3: 154-165 bpm)
  - 15 min cool-down (Z1-Z2: 120-154 bpm)
- **Evening**: Functional strength training - 20 minutes
  - Focus: Light maintenance, mobility, preparation for weekend
  - Include: Dynamic stretching, light bodyweight movements

*Secondary quality session - slightly shorter than Week 35 due to Wednesday intervals*

## Saturday

- **Planned**: No scheduled activities
- **Optional**: Home strength session if feeling energetic
- **Note**: Family time priority - keep spontaneous

## Sunday

- **Planned**: No scheduled activities  
- **Optional**: Easy walk or gentle movement if desired
- **Note**: Rest and preparation for Week 37

## Backup Options for Busy/Missed Sessions

**Missed Wednesday Intervals:**
- 4 x 4 minutes @ Z3-Z4 with 2-minute recoveries (35 min total)
- Evening option: 8 x 1 minute @ Z4-Z5 with 1-minute recoveries (20 min)

**Missed Friday Tempo:**
- 3 x 6 minutes @ Z3 with 2-minute recoveries during lunch
- Evening stair climbing: 20 minutes at comfortably hard effort

**Weather/Time Alternatives:**
- Indoor intervals: Stair climbing with 2-minute hard/1-minute easy pattern
- Hotel/travel: 15-minute bodyweight circuit (burpees, mountain climbers, jump squats)

---

## Weekly Targets

- **Total running time**: ~140 minutes (slight increase from Week 35)
- **Quality sessions**: 2 (intervals + tempo for complete lactate threshold development)
- **Strength sessions**: 3 completed (70 minutes total)
- **Heart rate focus**: Proper Z4 interval execution + controlled Z3 tempo

## Progression Notes

**Building from Week 35:**
- Added structured intervals (6x3min @ Z4) for lactate threshold power
- Reduced Friday tempo duration to accommodate Wednesday quality load
- Maintained same easy run durations for consistent aerobic stimulus

**Key Adaptations:**
- Two quality sessions requiring 48-hour spacing for proper recovery
- Wednesday intervals are the week's priority session
- Friday tempo is secondary quality work at slightly lower intensity

## Next Week Preview

*Week 37 will maintain dual quality structure while potentially extending one easy run or adding fartlek variety, depending on adaptation to interval workload.*

## Technical Notes

**Interval Execution (Wednesday):**
- Target effort: "Comfortably hard" - sustainable for full 3 minutes
- Pacing: Should feel controlled in first minute, steady in second/third
- Recovery: Keep moving but bring heart rate below 150 bpm between efforts
- Adjustment: If struggling, reduce to 4x3min or 6x2min

**Tempo Execution (Friday):**
- Target effort: "Comfortably hard but controlled" - could hold conversation in short phrases
- Pacing: Consistent throughout 20-minute block
- Strategy: Start conservatively, build into rhythm over first 5 minutes

## Motivation

You're progressing perfectly! Week 35 established your routine, and Week 36 introduces the structured speed work that will develop your lactate threshold. The dual quality approach (intervals + tempo) provides complete physiological stimulus while respecting lunch break time constraints. Focus on consistency over perfection - completing 80% of planned sessions puts you well ahead of where you started.

## Recovery & Adaptation Signals

**Green Lights** (proceed as planned):
- Heart rate drops to target zones within 60-90 seconds of interval recoveries
- Can hit target paces without excessive strain
- Sleep quality remains good
- Energy levels stable throughout week

**Yellow Lights** (modify but continue):
- Intervals feel harder than Z4 effort - reduce to 4x3min or extend recoveries
- Friday tempo feels labored - reduce to 15 minutes or shift to Z2 easy pace
- Fatigue building - skip one strength session

**Red Lights** (rest/easy week):
- Cannot hit Z4 targets even with full effort
- Heart rate elevated at rest
- Sleep significantly disrupted
- Multiple missed sessions due to fatigue
