   - W04: 4x + 5x 90sec ESTABLISHED ✅
   - **W05: 5x + 6x 2min COMPLETED ✅✅✅** ← BREAKTHROUGH!
   - Legs sustained 2min efforts across BOTH sessions = neuromuscular problem SOLVED!

3. ✅ **Power INCREASED!**
   - Mon: 227W avg
   - Wed: 241W avg (+6% trotz +1 rep!)
   - **Zeigt**: Body getting STRONGER, not weaker from increased load!

4. ✅ **Recovery IMPROVED!**
   - Mon: 43 bpm HR-drop between intervals
   - Wed: 54 bpm HR-drop (+26% better recovery!)
   - Thu: 129 bpm @ 120-140 target = TEXTBOOK recovery execution!
   - **Recovery mastery achieved!**

5. ✅ **Volume Progress** (137min vs 155-170min target):
   - Currently: 81-88% of target (Mon + Wed + Thu = 137min)
   - **Need**: +18-33min more → Sunday 45-50min = **TARGET WILL BE EXCEEDED!**
   - With Sunday: 182-187min total = 107-110% of target! 🎯

**Recovery Metrics - W05**:

| Date | HRV (SDNN) | RHR | Sleep | Next-Day | Assessment |
|------|-----------|-----|-------|----------|------------|
| Jan 25 | 45.92ms ✅ | 56 ✅ | 361min ⚠️ | Sun rest | Good |
| Jan 26 | 36.09ms ⚠️ | 59 ⚠️ | 432min ✅ | Mon 5x intervals | Pre-quality dip |
| Jan 27 | 38.47ms ⚠️ | 58 ⚠️ | 458min ✅ | Tue rest | Recovering |
| Jan 28 | 29.05ms 🚨 | 60 ⚠️ | 320min 🚨 | Wed 6x intervals | LOW - short sleep! |
| Jan 29 | 35.61ms ⚠️ | 54 ✅ | 418min ✅ | Thu recovery | Recovering |
| Jan 30 | 42.8ms ✅ | 55 ✅ | 438min ✅ | Fri rest | Good rebound! |
| Jan 31 | 54.96ms ✅ | 54 ✅ | 424min ✅ | Sa/Su | EXCELLENT! |

**Recovery Pattern Shows**:
- **HRV dipped** during quality days (29-38ms) = expected under load
- **BUT rebounded strongly** to 55ms by Jan 31 = recovery WORKING!
- **RHR stable** 54-60 bpm = cardiovascular handling load well
- **Sleep critical**: Jan 28 short sleep (320min) correlated with low HRV
- **Key insight**: Despite low HRV mid-week, body RECOVERED and performed!
- **Verdict**: Progressive loading working, recovery effective!

**KEY LEARNINGS FROM W05**:

1. **Extended intervals SUCCESSFUL**: 2min efforts across 2 sessions = legs adapted!
2. **Power progression**: +6% Wed vs Mon = strength improving!
3. **Recovery mastery**: Thu 129 bpm = -19 bpm vs W04 recovery runs = learned how to recover properly!
4. **HR-Drop improved**: 54 bpm Wed vs 43 bpm Mon = cardiovascular efficiency increasing!
5. **Volume compatible**: 137min + quality sessions = body can handle both!
6. **Sleep matters**: Short sleep (320min) = low HRV, but body still performed!

**USER FEEDBACK - CRITICAL!** 💪:

> "Von meinem subjektiven Gefühl her hab ich die intervalle gut vertragen. Ich fand mich auch nicht durchwegen müde. Ich find wir können so weiter machen. Ich bin motiviert"

**ANALYSIS**:
- ✅ **Intervalle gut vertragen** = body ready for progression!
- ✅ **Nicht durchweg müde** = recovery working, no overload!
- ✅ **Wir können so weiter machen** = green light to continue aggressive timeline!
- ✅ **Ich bin motiviert** = mental readiness = powerful indicator!

**DECISION**: User feedback + objective data (power +6%, recovery improved, volume achieved) = **GREEN LIGHT für W06 continuation!** 🚀

## Week 06 Training Philosophy - CONTINUE INTERVAL EXTENSION

**Priorität**: SAME AS W05 - Continue 2min intervals, maintain high volume!

**Post-Corona Phase 6 Strategy (Consolidation)**:
- Volume: 160-175min (5 runs) - CONTINUE HIGH VOLUME
- Quality: 2x interval sessions (Mon 5x 2min + Wed 6x 2min) @ Z4 (160-167 bpm) - **SAME AS W05!**
- Recovery: Tue + Thu @ Z1 (120-140 bpm) - active recovery
- Rest: Friday (full recovery day)
- Easy run: Weekend (45-50min) - MAINTAIN
- Strength: 2x 30min (Mon + Wed evenings) - NON-NEGOTIABLE

**Weekly Structure - IDENTICAL TO W05**:
- **Monday**: Quality #1 (5x 2min intervals @ Z4)
- **Tuesday**: Recovery run (30-35min flush)
- **Wednesday**: Quality #2 (6x 2min intervals @ Z4) - MAIN SESSION
- **Thursday**: Recovery run (30-35min prep for weekend)
- **Friday**: Rest from running (full recovery)
- **Saturday**: Optional strength OR rest
- **Sunday**: Easy run 45-50min (longest run of week)

**Why REPEAT W05 Structure?**:

Der User sagt: **"Ich find wir können so weiter machen"** = **CONTINUE, not change!**

**Rationale for Consolidation**:
1. **User feedback clear**: "Gut vertragen" + "nicht müde" = W05 structure optimal!
2. **Conservative progression**: W05 was FIRST successful 2min session - need to consolidate!
3. **Avoid injury**: Jumping from 2min → 3min too fast = risk after W03 leg failure history!
4. **Build confidence**: Repeating 2min successfully = mental + physical consolidation!
5. **Race timeline**: 7 weeks = still enough time for tempo work W07+!

**Progressive Loading Logic**:
- W03: 3x 2min FAILED ❌ (too soon)
- W04: 4x + 5x 90sec ESTABLISHED ✅
- **W05: 5x + 6x 2min SUCCESS ✅** (breakthrough!)
- **W06: 5x + 6x 2min CONSOLIDATION ✅** ← WE ARE HERE (solidify gains!)
- W07: Extend to 3min OR race-specific tempo (apply threshold to longer efforts)
- W08+: Trail-specific long efforts

**Key Differences vs. Racing to 3min**:
- **Risk**: Jumping 2min → 3min = +50% duration = high injury risk after W03 failure
- **Reward**: Consolidating 2min = build confidence + strength foundation
- **Timeline**: 7 weeks still allows 1 week consolidation + 4-5 weeks race-specific + 1 week taper

**User wants "so weiter machen"** = **stick with what's working!** ✅

## Monday, February 2

- **Morning**: RHR/Recovery Check
  - Expected: RHR 54-58 bpm (recovered from W05 Sunday rest)
  - HRV: 45+ ms preferred (Jan 31 was 55ms = excellent!)
  - **User feedback**: "Gut vertragen" + "motiviert" = GREEN LIGHT
  - Decision Matrix:
    - RHR <58 bpm + Energy >7/10 = GREEN → Quality session
    - RHR 58-60 bpm = YELLOW → Reduce to 4x 2min
    - RHR >60 bpm = RED → Easy run only
- **Lunch**: **Hill Intervals #1** - 45min total
  - **Structure**:
    - 12min @ Z1 warmup (130-145 bpm)
    - **5x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)** w/ 3min recovery jog between
    - 10min @ Z1 cool-down
  - **Target HR**: 160-167 bpm (Z4 threshold)
  - **Effort**: RPE 7-8/10 (controlled hard)
  - **W05 Reference**: Mon 5x 2min done @ 176 bpm max - repeat this success!
  - **Focus**: Consistent execution across all 5 reps, maintain form
  - **Bailout**: If HR <155 bpm or legs failing → abort, switch to easy
  - **Purpose**: Consolidate 2min interval capacity
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min
  - Leg power focus (jump squats, Bulgarian splits, single-leg RDL, calf raises)
  - Core work
  - **Note**: Can move to Thu/Sa if too much after intervals

*Monday = Quality Day #1 - Consolidate Extended Intervals*

---

## Tuesday, February 3

- **Morning**: Recovery Check post-Monday intervals
  - **Assess**: How did Mon 5x 2min feel? DOMS? Movement quality?
  - **RHR**: Should stay <62 bpm (spike = overload from Mon)
  - Decision Matrix:
    - RHR <60 bpm + legs OK → 35min recovery
    - RHR 60-62 bpm = YELLOW → 30min easy
    - RHR >62 bpm = RED → Rest day OR 25min only
- **Lunch**: **Recovery Run** - 30-35min @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
  - **Target HR**: 120-140 bpm (EASY recovery!)
  - **Pace**: 6:00-7:00 min/km (slow = correct after Mon intervals!)
  - **Route**: FLAT, familiar
  - **Mental**: "Active recovery post-intervals - flush legs"
  - **W05 Reference**: Thu 129 bpm = TEXTBOOK execution - repeat this!
  - **Success**: Easy feel, HR stable, legs loosening
  - **CRITICAL**: This is RECOVERY, not training! Keep HR <140 bpm!
- **Evening**: Free

*Tuesday = Recovery Day #1*

---

## Wednesday, February 4

- **Morning**: Recovery Check
  - **Critical**: Recovered from Mon intervals? RHR back to baseline?
  - RHR should be <60 bpm, Energy >7/10
  - **User context**: "Gut vertragen" = likely ready for main session
  - Decision:
    - RHR <58 + legs good = GREEN → 6x 2min as planned
    - RHR 58-60 + legs OK = YELLOW → 5x 2min
    - RHR >60 OR legs tired = RED → Easy run only, NO intervals
- **Lunch**: **Hill Intervals #2 (MAIN SESSION)** - 50min total
  - **Structure**:
    - 15min @ Z1 warmup (130-145 bpm)
    - **6x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)** w/ 3min recovery jog between
    - 10min @ Z1 cool-down
  - **Interval execution**:
    - **Target HR**: 160-167 bpm (Z4 threshold)
    - **Effort**: RPE 7-8/10 (controlled hard, NOT max)
    - **Focus**: Sustained power, consistent pace, uphill if possible
    - **Recovery**: 3min @ Z1 (130-140 bpm) between reps
    - **Key**: Push but stay controlled - maintain form through all 6
  - **W05 Reference**: Wed 6x 2min @ 241W, Max HR 170 - repeat this success!
  - **Bailout**: If HR <155 bpm or legs failing → stop, cut to 4-5 reps
  - **Total duration**: ~50min
  - **Purpose**: Consolidate main quality session capacity
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min (RECOMMENDED)
  - **Leg Power Focus**:
    - Jump squats 3x8 (explosive!)
    - Bulgarian split squats 3x10 each leg
    - Single-leg RDL 3x10 each
    - Box step-ups 3x12 each
    - Calf raises 3x15

*Wednesday = Quality Day #2 (MAIN INTERVALS) - Consolidate*

---

## Thursday, February 5

- **Morning**: Recovery Check post-Wed intervals - CRITICAL!
  - **Assess**: How do legs feel? DOMS? Movement quality?
  - **RHR**: MUST be <62 bpm (spike = overload from 2 quality sessions)
  - **Decision**:
    - RHR <60 + legs OK → 35min recovery run
    - RHR 60-62 + legs tired → 30min easy
    - RHR >62 OR legs very sore → REST DAY
- **Lunch**: **Recovery Run** - 30-35min @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)

  - **W05 Reference**: Thu 129 bpm @ 6:09/km = PERFEKT - aim for similar!
  - **Success**: Easy feel, HR stable, legs responsive
  - **CRITICAL**: If HR drifting >140 or legs heavy → cut short!
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min (if not done Mon/Wed)
  - Same structure as above
  - **Flexibility**: Can be moved to Saturday if needed

*Thursday = Recovery Day #2*

---

## Friday, February 6

- **Morning**: Recovery Check
  - **Assess**: How recovered from Mon + Wed intervals?
  - **RHR**: Check trend over week
  - **HRV**: Should be rebounding if recovering well (W05: 43ms by Fri)
- **Lunch**: **Rest from running**
  - **Purpose**: Full recovery day post 2 quality sessions
  - **Mental**: "Let legs recover before weekend run"
  - **Active recovery**: Light walk 20-30min optional
- **Evening**: Free

*Rest day - recover from 2 quality + 2 recovery sessions*

---

## Weekend (Saturday Feb 7 - Sunday Feb 8)

*Rest OR optional strength*

---

### Sunday, February 8

- **Morning**: **Easy Run** - 45-50min @ Z1 (130-145 bpm) - MANDATORY
  - **Decision criteria**:
    - RHR <60 bpm + recovered = GO for 45-50min
    - RHR 60-62 = reduce to 40-45min
    - RHR >62 OR extreme fatigue = 35min or rest
  - **Target HR**: 130-145 bpm
  - **Pace**: 5:45-6:30 min/km
  - **Route**: Flat or slightly rolling OK
  - **Mental**: "Longest run of week - proving body handling 2 quality + high volume!"
  - **Purpose**: Complete volume target, prove recovery working
  - **W05 completion**: This run will exceed volume target (182-187min total)!
- **Afternoon**: Family priority
- **Focus**: Prep für W07 (consider 3min intervals OR race-specific tempo)

*Weekend run mandatory - longest run of week, proves recovery working*

---

## Backup Options & Flexibility

**Missed Monday**:
- Wed becomes MAIN quality session (6x 2min)
- Shift Tue/Thu recovery around Wed
- Still 4 runs = success

**Missed Wednesday**:
- **WICHTIG**: Wed = main session!
- Shift to Do if possible (then: Do intervals, Fr recovery)
- Or: Mon intervals only, focus volume rest of week

**Missed Thursday**:
- Not critical (recovery run)
- Tue + Wed + Fr = still 3 runs OK

**Missed Friday**:
- Already rest day - N/A

**Missed Weekend**:
- Try shift to Sa if possible
- Or: 4 runs (Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu) still good week

**If Intervals zu hart**:
- Mon: Drop to 4x 2min (instead of 5x)
- Wed: Drop to 5x 2min (instead of 6x)
- Or: Extend recovery between reps to 3:30-4min

**If DOMS sehr stark from Wed**:
- Thu + Fr: Both rest OR 25min max easy
- Skip weekend run
- W07: Reduce quality OR extend recovery

---

## Weekly Targets - CONSOLIDATE INTERVALS + MAINTAIN VOLUME

**Running Volume**:
- **Minimum**: 150min (5x 30-35min)

## Recovery Protocol - CONSOLIDATION MONITORING

### Daily Morning Checks - ESSENTIAL

**Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Su morgens (vor run decision)**:
1. **RHR**: <58 bpm = GREEN, 58-60 = YELLOW, >60 = RED
2. **Subjektive Energie**: 1-10 Scale (>7 = GREEN)
3. **HRV wenn möglich**: >42 = GREEN, 37-42 = YELLOW, <37 = RED
4. **Sleep letzte Nacht**: >6.5h (390min+) = GREEN
5. **Legs feel**: Fresh = GREEN, Tired = YELLOW, Sore = RED

**Thu morgen (post-Wed intervals check) - CRITICAL**:
1. **Leg soreness**: 1-10 scale
   - 0-3 = Normal, proceed with recovery run
   - 4-6 = Reduce Thu to 25-30min
   - 7-10 = Rest day, intervals too much
2. **Movement quality**: Stiff? Or loose?
3. **RHR**: Should stay <62 bpm (spike = overload)

### Decision Matrix W06

**GREEN LIGHT (Run as planned)**:
- RHR <58 bpm
- Energy >7/10
- HRV >42ms (if tracked)
- Sleep >6.5h (390min+)
- Legs feel fresh
- **User reports "gut vertragen" + "motiviert"**
- → Quality/easy run as planned

**YELLOW LIGHT (Modify)**:
- RHR 58-60 bpm
- Energy 6-7/10
- HRV 37-42ms
- Sleep 6-6.5h (360-390min)
- Legs slightly tired
- → Reduce duration OR reps

**RED LIGHT (Very Easy or Rest)**:
- RHR >60 bpm
- Energy <6/10
- HRV <37ms
- Sleep <6h (<360min)
- Legs sore/heavy (>6/10)
- → 25min @ 130-135 bpm OR rest day

### Consolidation-Specific Monitoring

**Key Question**: Can body REPEAT W05 success consistently?

**Positive signs** (repeat successful):
- Both quality sessions completed with similar HR (165-176 bpm)
- Power maintained or increased (227-241W range)
- Recovery runs stay 120-140 bpm (129 bpm ideal)
- RHR rebounds to <58 by weekend
- No excessive DOMS (≤6/10)

**Yellow flags** (need adjustment):
- Struggling to complete 6 reps Wed (cut to 5x OK)
- HR not reaching 155+ on intervals (legs fatiguing)
- Recovery runs drift >140 bpm consistently
- RHR stays 60-62 all week
- DOMS 6-8/10

**Red flags** (back off):
- Can't complete Mon OR Wed session (injury risk!)
- HR <150 on intervals (same as W03 failure pattern)
- RHR >62 for 2+ consecutive days
- DOMS >8/10
- Extreme fatigue during easy runs

## Race-Specific Context

**Lindkogel Trail (7 Wochen out)** - Consolidation Phase:

**Timeline Update**:
- **W01-02** (completed): Test + Restart ✅
- **W03** (completed): Quality attempted (legs not ready) ⚠️
- **W04** (completed): Aggressive interval return (successful!) ✅
- **W05** (completed): EXTEND intervals (5x + 6x 2min @ Z4) ✅✅✅ BREAKTHROUGH!
- **W06** (diese Woche): CONSOLIDATE 2min intervals (repeat W05 structure)
- **W07** (Feb 9+): Extend to 3min intervals OR race-specific tempo work
- **W08-09**: Long threshold efforts (3-5min reps, tempo runs 20-25min)
- **W10-12**: Trail-specific (long runs with elevation, sustained hills)
- **W13**: Taper begin
- **W14**: RACE (March 22)

**Why Consolidation Week Makes Sense**:
- **W05 was FIRST successful 2min session** - need to solidify gains!
- **Conservative progression**: 2min x2 weeks → 3min = sustainable
- **Injury prevention**: W03 leg failure history = be cautious with extensions
- **7 weeks still enough**: 1 week consolidation + 1 week 3min + 2 weeks tempo + 2 weeks trail + 1 taper = PERFECT
- **User wants "so weiter machen"** = stick with what's working!

**Progressive Quality Loading**:
- W05: 11 reps x 2min = ~22min @ Z4 (COMPLETED!)
- **W06: 11 reps x 2min = ~22min @ Z4** ← WE ARE HERE (consolidate!)
- W07: 10 reps x 3min = ~30min @ Z4 (extend duration)
- W08: Tempo run 20-25min sustained @ Z3-Z4 (apply to race scenarios)
- W09: Hill-specific sustained efforts 25-30min

---

## Week 06 Success Metrics - CONSOLIDATION & CONFIDENCE

**Must-Achieve (Top 3 Priorities)**:

1. **Complete BOTH Interval Sessions (Mon + Wed) AGAIN**
   - Mon: 5x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
   - Wed: 6x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
   - Hit target HR zone (>155 bpm minimum) on BOTH days
   - Complete ALL 11 reps (or 10+ if slight reduction needed)
   - **Success = proving W05 was repeatable, not a fluke!**

2. **Volume Target (5 Runs MANDATORY + Complete Volume)**
   - Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Su all required
   - Recovery runs (Tue/Thu) @ 120-140 bpm strict
   - Easy run (Su) @ 130-145 bpm 45-50min
   - Friday REST day
   - Total 160-175min volume minimum
   - **Success = sustaining high volume + quality load!**

3. **Recovery Quality MAINTAINED**
   - RHR stays <62 bpm on Tue morning (post-Mon)
   - RHR stays <62 bpm on Thu morning (post-Wed)
   - Recovery runs replicate W05 Thu quality (≤130 bpm)
   - Can complete both recovery runs comfortably
   - DOMS manageable (<7/10)
   - **Success = recovery systems working consistently!**

**Nice-to-Have**:
- HR hits 160-167 bpm on all 11 intervals
- Power similar or higher than W05 (227-241W range)
- 2x strength sessions done (flexible timing)
- Sleep 7h+ most nights (5+ nights @ 420min+)
- Both interval sessions feel "strong" not "struggling"
- Weekend run reaches 50min (upper target)

### Green Lights für W07 (Extend to 3min OR Tempo)

✅ **BOTH interval sessions completed**: Mon 5x + Wed 6x 2min @ 160-167 bpm
✅ **Execution quality maintained**: HR, power, form similar to W05
✅ **Recovery managed**: RHR <62 bpm both Tue + Thu mornings
✅ **Volume achieved**: 160-175min total (5 runs with Sunday complete)
✅ **Sustained threshold**: Completed 2min reps without leg failure AGAIN
✅ **User confidence high**: Feels "gut vertragen" + "motiviert"

**Wenn 5+ green lights** → W07 extend to 3min intervals (Mon 4-5x + Wed 5-6x 3min) OR race-specific tempo

### Yellow Lights (Repeat Consolidation)

⚠️ **Only 1 quality session**: Skipped Mon OR Wed intervals
⚠️ **Execution struggle**: HR below target (<155 bpm multiple intervals)
⚠️ **Volume low**: <155min total or <4 runs
⚠️ **Recovery compromised**: RHR >62 bpm for 2+ consecutive days
⚠️ **DOMS elevated**: 7-8/10 soreness, affecting runs
⚠️ **Power declined**: <220W average (vs W05's 227-241W)

**Wenn 2+ yellow lights** → W07 repeat W06 structure (5x + 6x 2min again) OR reduce to 1 quality/week

### Red Lights (Back to Shorter Intervals)

🚨 **<4 runs completed**: Couldn't manage volume + 2 quality
🚨 **Extreme fatigue**: Can't complete recovery runs
🚨 **RHR elevated**: >64 bpm persistent
🚨 **HRV crashed**: <35ms all week
🚨 **Interval failure**: Couldn't sustain 2min efforts (HR <150 or legs failing - W03 pattern!)
🚨 **Injury from intervals**: Muscle strain, tendon issue

**Wenn 1+ red lights** → W07 drop to 1 quality session per week OR return to 90sec intervals

## Coach's Notes - CONSOLIDATION = SMART PROGRESSION! 💯

**Warum W06 = Repeat W05 Structure? User wants "so weiter machen"!**

### Progressive Loading Science

**The Rule**: ACHIEVE → CONSOLIDATE → EXTEND

**Your Progression**:
- W03: 2min intervals ATTEMPTED (legs failed) ❌
- W04: 90sec intervals ESTABLISHED (4x + 5x completed) ✅
- W05: 2min intervals ACHIEVED (5x + 6x completed) ✅ **← BREAKTHROUGH!**
- **W06: 2min intervals CONSOLIDATE** ✅ **← WE ARE HERE (smart!)**
- W07: 3min intervals EXTEND 🎯 (apply gains to longer duration)

**Why Consolidation Week Matters**:

1. **Neuromuscular Adaptation Takes Time**
   - W05 = FIRST time legs sustained 2min x11 reps post-Corona
   - Muscle fiber recruitment patterns need reinforcement
   - 1 week = physiological "learning", 2 weeks = "locked in"
   - **Jumping too fast = W03 failure pattern risk!**

2. **Injury Prevention**
   - W03 showed: Legs weren't ready for 2min (failed after 3 reps)
   - W05 succeeded: But this was FIRST success
   - Extending too fast (2min → 3min = +50%) = strain risk
   - **2 weeks @ 2min → safer foundation for 3min**

3. **Mental Confidence Building**
   - W05 felt good: "Gut vertragen" + "motiviert"
   - Repeating success = builds psychological confidence
   - "I CAN do this consistently" > "I did it once"
   - **Mental strength = critical for race day performance**

4. **Timeline Still Permits**
   - 7 weeks to race = sufficient time!
   - W06: Consolidate (1 week)
   - W07: Extend to 3min (1 week)
   - W08-09: Tempo work 20-25min (2 weeks)
   - W10-12: Trail-specific (3 weeks)
   - W13: Taper (1 week)
   - **Math checks out = no need to rush!**

### User Feedback Interpretation

**"Wir können so weiter machen"** = Continue W05 structure!

**What User MEANS**:
- "The 5x + 6x 2min structure works" ✅
- "My body handled it well" ✅
- "I'm not overtrained" ✅
- "Keep going with this approach" ✅

**What User DOESN'T Mean**:
- "Make it harder immediately" ❌
- "Jump to 3min intervals now" ❌
- "I need more stress" ❌

**Interpretation**: User wants to MAINTAIN successful structure = **repeat W05 approach!**

### The Conservative Approach = Faster Long-Term

**Option A** (Aggressive - RISKY):
- W06: Jump to 3min intervals (4x + 5x)
- Risk: Legs not ready (similar to W03)
- If failure: Back to 2min, lost 2 weeks
- **Net result**: SLOWER progression + injury risk

**Option B** (Conservative - SMART):
- W06: Repeat 2min intervals (5x + 6x)
- Benefit: Solidify gains, build confidence
- If success: Strong foundation for W07 3min
- **Net result**: FASTER progression + safer

**Your History Supports Conservative**:
- W03: Jumped too fast (2min attempt) = FAILED
- W04: Backed off to 90sec = SUCCESS
- W05: Extended to 2min (first time) = SUCCESS
- **W06: Consolidate 2min (smart play)** ✅

### What W06 Achieves

**Physical Adaptations**:
- Muscle fiber recruitment @ 2min = reinforced
- Neuromuscular pathways = strengthened
- Lactate clearance capacity = consolidated
- Power output @ threshold = locked in
- **Body "learns" this is the new normal**

**Mental Adaptations**:
- Confidence: "I can do this consistently"
- Pacing: Better feel for 2min effort
- Recovery: Understand recovery needs better
- **Mental toughness = builds through repetition**

**Recovery Systems**:
- Cardiovascular system: Adapts to repeated quality load
- Sleep/HRV patterns: Establish consistent response
- DOMS management: Learn what's normal vs. warning
- **Recovery efficiency = improves with consistency**

### Volume + Quality Balance

**W06 Weekly Load**:
- Quality: 22min @ Z4 (11x 2min intervals) - SAME AS W05
- Volume: 160-175min (5 runs) - SLIGHTLY MORE than W05
- Longest run: 45-50min - MAINTAINED
- Strength: 2x 30min - CONTINUED
- **Total stress**: HIGH but SUSTAINABLE (proven in W05!)

**Why This Balance Works**:
- Quality NOT increased (same 11x 2min)
- Volume SLIGHTLY increased (+23-38min vs W05 actual 137min)
- Recovery structure MAINTAINED (Tue/Thu recovery, Fri rest)
- Strength FLEXIBLE (can adjust based on fatigue)
- **Load manageable = proven by W05 success!**

### Timeline to Race - 7 Weeks

**W06 (diese Woche)**: Consolidate 2min intervals ← YOU ARE HERE
**W07 (Feb 9+)**: Extend to 3min intervals (4-5x + 5-6x) OR tempo work
**W08 (Feb 16+)**: Race-specific tempo (20-25min sustained @ Z3-Z4)
**W09 (Feb 23+)**: Long tempo + hill work (30min+ sustained)
**W10-12 (Mar 2-23)**: Trail-specific (long runs 60-75min, vertical 400-600m)
**W13 (Mar 24+)**: Taper (reduce volume 40-50%)
**W14 (Mar 22)**: RACE! 🏔️

**7 weeks = DOABLE with consolidation week**:
- 1 week consolidation (W06)
- 1 week extension (W07)
- 2 weeks tempo work (W08-09)
- 3 weeks trail-specific (W10-12)
- 1 week taper (W13)
- **Math checks out = smart progression!**

### User Motivation = Powerful Indicator

**"Ich bin motiviert"** = Critical psychological signal!

**Why This Matters**:
- Motivation = mental energy for training
- Burnout = demotivation + physical fatigue
- W05 ended: Motivated + "gut vertragen" = NO BURNOUT!
- **Repeating structure maintains motivation = sustainable!**

**Risk of Jumping Too Fast**:
- 3min intervals = harder → potential frustration
- Failure = demotivation ("why can't I do this?")
- Injury = forced rest → motivation crash
- **Better: Maintain motivation through repeated success!**

### Practical Execution - Same as W05

**Mon Intervals** (5x 2min):
- Warmup: 12min easy (CRITICAL!)
- Intervals: 2min @ Z4 (aim 165-176 bpm peak like W05)
- Recovery: 3min @ Z1 (full recovery <140 bpm)
- Cooldown: 10min easy
- **Key**: REPLICATE W05 Mon execution!

**Tue Recovery** (30-35min):
- Target: 120-140 bpm (strict!)
- Pace: 6:00-7:00 min/km (slow = correct!)
- **Goal**: Match W05 Thu perfection (129 bpm @ 6:09/km)!

**Wed Intervals** (6x 2min):
- Warmup: 15min easy (longer than Mon!)
- Intervals: 2min @ Z4 (aim 165-170 bpm peak like W05)
- Recovery: 3min @ Z1 (full recovery)
- Cooldown: 10min easy
- **Key**: REPLICATE W05 Wed execution (241W, 54 bpm drop)!

**Thu Recovery** (30-35min):
- Same as Tuesday
- **Critical**: This proves recovery system working!

**Fr Rest**: MANDATORY (like W05)

**Su Easy Run** (45-50min):
- Target: 130-145 bpm
- Pace: 5:45-6:30 min/km
- **Goal**: Prove body handling total weekly load!

### Die Wichtigste Message 💯

**W06 Erfolg = Repeat W05 success consistently!**

**JA**:
- 2x quality: Mon 5x + Wed 6x 2min @ 160-167 bpm (SAME AS W05!)
- 5x runs @ 30-50min each (Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Su)
- 2x strength 30min (flexible timing)
- Total 160-175min
- HR 160+ on intervals (legs sustaining effort!)
- Recovery runs 120-140 bpm (replicate W05 Thu 129 bpm!)
- Feel "worked but recovering" (like W05!)

**NEIN**:
- Jumping to 3min intervals (too soon!)
- Skipping recovery runs (all 5 runs mandatory!)
- "Pushing through" if DOMS >8/10 or RHR >64
- Ignoring fatigue signals (learn from W03!)

**Consolidation Progression**:
- W06: 5x + 6x 2min @ Z4 (solidify gains)
- W07: 4-5x + 5-6x 3min @ Z4 (extend if W06 successful)
- W08: Tempo 20-25min @ Z3-Z4 (race application)
- W09: Trail-specific sustained efforts

## Week 07 Preview

*Assuming successful Week 06 (BOTH quality sessions + 160min+ volume):*

**TWO OPTIONS for W07**:

**Option A - Extend Duration** 🔥:
- **Mon**: Hill intervals 4-5x 3min @ Z4 (extend from 2min to 3min!)
- **Wed**: Hill intervals 5-6x 3min @ Z4 (main session extended!)
- **Tue + Thu**: Easy runs 35-40min @ Z1
- **Weekend**: Easy 50min mandatory
- **Total**: 165-180min
- **Strength**: 2x 30min (continue leg power focus)

**Option B - Race-Specific Tempo** 🎯:
- **Mon**: Tempo run 20min @ Z3-Z4 (sustained threshold)
- **Wed**: Hill intervals 5x 3min @ Z4 (mix tempo + intervals)
- **Tue + Thu**: Easy runs 35-40min @ Z1
- **Weekend**: Easy 50-55min
- **Total**: 165-180min
- **Strength**: 2x 30min

**Decision Criteria**:
- If W06 feels STRONG (HR 165+, power >230W, easy recovery) → **Option A** (extend to 3min)
- If W06 feels GOOD but not dominant → **Option B** (apply threshold to tempo)
- If W06 struggles (HR <160, DOMS >7, fatigue) → **Repeat W06** (consolidate again)

**Focus**:
- Apply consolidated 2min fitness to longer efforts
- Build toward trail-specific sustained work
- Maintain volume consistency (165-180min)

*W07 depends on W06 execution - consolidate first, extend second!*
