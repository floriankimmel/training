**Thu Nov 6 - TOROclassic**: 58min workout @ 138 bpm avg, 172 max HR
- **Context**: Total classic skiing replaced planned tempo run
- Assessment: Active recovery effect (138 bpm reasonable), alternative training

**Fri Nov 7**: No data - likely rest

### Week 45 Performance Analysis

**HR Discipline Pattern - CRITICAL ISSUE**:
- Mon: 147.8 bpm (target 130-145) = +2.8 over
- Tue: 143.9 bpm (quality session, acceptable avg but intervals conservative)
- Wed: 148 bpm (target 130-145) = +3 over
- **Pattern**: 3 consecutive days at Z2 ceiling on easy runs
- **Feedback noted**: "Critical HR discipline problem" after Wed

**Interval Quality - CONSERVATIVE BUT STRONG**:
- HR: 156.8, 156.2, 160.6, 163.1 bpm (avg 159 bpm vs target 160-172)
- Power: 328W → 364W → 334W → 379W (peak 569W)
- **Assessment**: 5-10 bpm under target BUT power exceeded goals (280-320W target)
- Progressive strength (379W final) = retained fitness, ready for next progression

**Thursday Conflict Analysis**:
- Planned: Tempo run (20min sustained Z3)
- Actual: TOROclassic 58min @ 138 bpm
- **Impact**: Missed key tempo session but got cross-training benefit
- **User context**: "Had to skip Thursday because in total classic workout"

**Positive Indicators**:
- ✅ Completed M/T/W runs consistently
- ✅ Power outputs excellent (379W peak, 328-364W sustained)
- ✅ Recovery strong between intervals (HR drops 135-138 bpm)
- ✅ Mechanical efficiency high (89.3 rpm cadence Wed)
- ✅ No injury/illness signals

**Areas Needing Focus**:
- ⚠️ Easy run HR discipline (3 days at 147-148 bpm vs 130-145 target)
- ⚠️ Interval intensity confidence (can push harder based on power)
- ⚠️ Tempo session missed (cross-training substitute not same stimulus)

### Recovery Context

**Note**: Week 45 feedback analysis available through Wed Nov 5 only. No recovery metrics data (HRV/RHR/sleep) provided for assessment.

**Training Load Summary**:
- 3 runs completed (M/T/W) = ~2h 15min total
- Thu cross-training (TOROclassic 58min)
- Volume slightly below target due to Thu tempo miss

---

## Week 46 Training Philosophy

**Progression from Week 45**:
- Increase interval volume: 4x3min → 5x3min (+25%)
- Extend tempo duration: 20min planned (missed) → 22min
- **Critical focus**: HR discipline on easy runs (130-145 bpm NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Build confidence in interval intensity (165-172 bpm capable)
- Optional weekend long run introduction (60min)

**Key Objectives**:
1. **Fix easy run HR drift**: Mon/Wed must average 135-145 bpm (not 147-148!)
2. **Interval progression**: 5x3min with earlier intensity commitment
3. **Complete tempo session**: Cannot miss 2 weeks in row - trail race needs sustained Z3
4. **Weekly volume**: Target 3-3.5 hours with optional weekend

---

## Monday, November 10

- **Lunch**: **Easy Run - HR DISCIPLINE PRIORITY** - 45-50 min @ Z1-Z2
  - **CRITICAL**: 130-145 bpm target (Week 45 was 147.8 bpm - TOO HIGH)
  - **Strategy**: Start at 5:45-6:00 min/km pace (slower than Week 45's 5:24)
  - **HR Protocol**:
    - First 10min: Establish 135-140 bpm baseline
    - Every 5min: Check HR, slow if approaching 146 bpm
    - Max allowable: 150 bpm (not 155+ like Week 45)
  - **Route**: Flat terrain only
  - **Mental cue**: "This IS training" - 80% of trail ultra work is this intensity
  - **Success metric**: Avg 135-145 bpm, max <150 bpm
- **Evening**: Free

*Priority #1: Fix easy run HR discipline - pace will be slower, that's correct!*

---

## Tuesday, November 11

- **Lunch**: **Hill Intervals 5x3min** - 55 min total
  - 12 min warm-up (Z1: 120-146 bpm)
  - **Main set**: 5 x 3 minutes uphill @ Z3-Z4 (160-172 bpm)
    - **Progression**: 4x3min → 5x3min (+25% volume)
    - **Terrain**: 2-3% gradient hills (Week 45: 61m elevation worked well)
    - **Intensity strategy** (learn from Week 45's conservatism):
      - Rep 1: 160-165 bpm (controlled start)
      - Rep 2-3: 165-170 bpm (commit earlier than Week 45)
      - Rep 4-5: 168-172 bpm (demonstrate capacity - you have 379W!)
    - **Power target**: 320-370W (Week 45 showed 379W capable)
    - Recovery: 2-3min full active recovery
    - **Week 45 lesson**: 156-163 bpm was conservative, power proved capacity for more
  - 12 min cool-down (Z1, keep <146 bpm)
- **Evening**: Functional strength - 25 min
  - Trail-specific: single-leg stability, glutes, hip strength
  - Controlled volume - support running, don't fatigue

*Volume progression with intensity confidence - power outputs proved you're ready*

---

## Wednesday, November 12

- **Lunch**: **Easy Recovery Run** - 40 min @ Z1-Z2
  - **CRITICAL REPLICATION**: Same HR discipline as Monday
  - **Target**: 130-145 bpm avg (Week 45 Wed was 148 bpm - reduce by 3-5 bpm!)
  - **Route**: Flat terrain - this is recovery, not training
  - **Pace expectation**: 5:30-6:00 min/km (accept slower pace!)
  - **HR checks**: Every 5min, slow immediately if >145 bpm
  - **Purpose**: True recovery 24h post-intervals for Thu tempo quality
- **Evening**: Light mobility - 20 min (optional)
  - Gentle stretching, foam rolling, breathing
  - Keep light - Thu tempo needs fresh legs

*2nd chance at easy run discipline - critical for trail base building*

---

## Thursday, November 13

- **Lunch**: **Extended Tempo Run** - 52 min total
  - 10 min warm-up (Z1: 120-146 bpm)
  - **22 min sustained tempo** @ Z3 effort (154-165 bpm)
    - **Duration increase**: Week 45 planned 20min (missed) → 22min
    - **Route**: Rolling terrain with 60-100m elevation
    - **Strategy**: Start 158 bpm, settle 160-165 bpm by min 5
    - **Sustained Z3 practice**: This is core trail race intensity
    - **Effort cue**: "Comfortably hard" - race pace for hours
    - **Target**: 158-165 bpm avg for full 22min block
  - 20 min cool-down (Z1-Z2: 120-154 bpm)
  - **Week 45 context**: Thu tempo missed (TOROclassic conflict) - CANNOT miss 2 weeks
- **Evening**: Free (recovery priority)

*MUST COMPLETE - 2nd missed tempo would compromise trail base development*

---

## Friday, November 14

- **Lunch**: Rest from running
- **Evening**: Optional light strength - 20-25 min
  - Mobility focus, activation work
  - Can skip if fatigued from week

*Rest day - consolidate week's training*

---

## Weekend (Saturday Nov 15 - Sunday Nov 16)

### Saturday
- **No scheduled activities** - Keep unplanned per preference
- **Optional Long-ish Run**: 60-75 min easy @ Z1-Z2 (120-154 bpm)
  - **Purpose**: First extended "long run" for trail progression
  - **Target HR**: 135-150 bpm (practice sustained easy discipline)
  - **Route**: Trails if possible, gentle rolling
  - **This is bonus**: Only if schedule allows, body feels good
  - **Trail adaptation**: Time on feet > speed
- **Alternative**: 30min strength session at home

### Sunday
- **No scheduled activities** - Family priority
- **Optional**: Light movement, walking, stretching
- **Focus**: Full recovery, Week 47 prep

*Weekend flexibility maintained - optional long run introduces endurance progression*

---

## Backup Options

**Missed Tuesday Intervals**:
- Reduced: 4x3min uphill (maintain quality, less volume)
- Flat alternative: 5x3min @ Z4 flat (not ideal but acceptable)
- Minimum: 3x3min uphill with full recovery

**Missed Thursday Tempo**:
- Alternative: 4x5min @ Z3 with 2min recovery
- Reduced: 15min sustained Z3 (maintain stimulus, cut volume)
- **Priority**: This is Week 46's KEY session after Week 45 miss

**Time Constraints**:
- Priority #1: Thursday tempo (cannot miss 2 weeks)
- Priority #2: Tuesday intervals 5x3min
- Can skip: Friday (already rest), optional weekend

---

## Detailed Workout Execution

### Tuesday Hill Intervals (5x3min @ Z3-Z4)

**Week 45 Analysis Integration**:
- Structure was perfect: 12min warmup + 4x(3min+2min) + 15min cooldown
- HR conservative: 156-163 bpm avg (5-10 bpm under target)
- Power excellent: 328-379W (peak 569W) = capacity proven
- Progressive finish: 379W in Rep 4 = strongest finish

**Week 46 Execution Plan**:
- **Early commitment**: Don't wait til Rep 4 to reach 165+ bpm
- **Rep 1**: 160-165 bpm (confident start based on proven power)
- **Rep 2-3**: 165-170 bpm (trail race needs this sustained intensity)
- **Rep 4-5**: 168-172 bpm (you have 379W capacity - use it!)
- **Power confirmation**: >320W throughout (Week 45 showed 328-379W)
- **Recovery**: Full 2-3min - quality over rushed intervals

**Success Metrics**:
- Complete all 5 reps with controlled breathing
- HR progression across reps (not flat like Week 45)
- Power >320W average per interval
- Final rep = strongest (replicate Week 45's 379W finish)

**Mental Approach**:
- Week 45 showed you CAN (379W proves capacity)
- Conservative start was post-race caution (valid Week 45)
- Week 46 = build on that base with earlier intensity

### Thursday Extended Tempo (22min @ Z3)

**Week 45 Context**: Tempo session missed due to TOROclassic conflict

**Week 46 Critical Importance**:
- **Cannot miss 2 consecutive tempos** - trail race = sustained Z3 for hours
- This is your RACE PACE for 34km effort
- Week 45 intervals proved fitness retained - tempo will confirm threshold

**Execution Strategy**:
- **Minutes 1-5**: 156-160 bpm (confident Z3 entry)
- **Minutes 6-18**: 160-165 bpm (sustained middle-range Z3)
- **Minutes 19-22**: 162-168 bpm (finish strong if feeling good)
- **Rolling terrain**: 60-100m elevation (practice effort-based pacing)
- **Mental cue**: "This is my 34km race effort" - sustainable hard
- **Breathing**: Rhythmic, controlled - not gasping

**Success Metrics**:
- 22min average 158-165 bpm despite terrain
- Consistent effort across climbs/flats/descents
- Finish feeling "I could continue this effort longer"
- Mental confidence in sustained Z3 capacity

### Monday & Wednesday Easy Runs - HR DISCIPLINE

**Week 45 Problem**: Mon 147.8 bpm, Wed 148 bpm (both 3+ bpm over 145 target)

**Week 46 Solution Protocol**:

**Start Protocol**:
- First 5-10min: Run at 5:45-6:00 min/km pace (slower than feels natural)
- Establish 135-140 bpm baseline before settling into rhythm
- If HR >142 in first 10min, you started too fast

**During-Run Checks**:
- Every 5 minutes: Glance at HR
- If 145-148 bpm: Slow pace immediately (don't wait)
- If >148 bpm: Walk 30sec, then resume slower
- Target sweet spot: 138-145 bpm sustained

**Pace Acceptance**:
- 5:30-6:00 min/km is CORRECT for this intensity
- Week 45's 5:19-5:24 was TOO FAST (hence high HR)
- Slower pace = correct training for trail ultra base

**Why This Matters**:
- 80% of trail training is Z1-Z2 (vs 10K racing's 60%)
- Consistent 147-148 bpm = not enough recovery for quality sessions
- Race day start MUST feel this easy (then sustain 3-4 hours)

## Race-Specific Progression

**Lindkogel Trail Context** (19 weeks out):
- Need to build from current 50min runs → future 2-3h long runs
- Week 46 optional 60-75min = first step in long run progression
- Hill intervals = sustained climbing power (race has 1000m+)
- Tempo work = race effort practice (34km will be 3-4h sustained Z2-Z3)

**Base Building Phase Progression**:
- Week 45: 4x3min hills, easy run HR issues, tempo missed
- Week 46: 5x3min hills, FIX easy HR, complete tempo, optional long run
- Week 47 preview: 6x3min hills, 25min tempo, 75-90min long run

**Training Distribution Target** (trail racing = 80/15/5):
- 80% Z1-Z2: Easy runs + long run (THIS IS WHY HR DISCIPLINE CRITICAL)
- 15% Z3: Tempo work (sustainable race pace)
- 5% Z4+: Hill intervals (race-specific power)

---

## Week 46 Critical Success Factors

1. **Fix Easy Run HR**: Mon/Wed avg 135-145 bpm (not 147-148!)
2. **Complete Thu Tempo**: Cannot miss 2 consecutive weeks
3. **Interval Intensity**: Earlier commitment to 165-172 bpm (proven capable)
4. **Optional Long Run**: If Sat allows, 60-75min introduces endurance progression
5. **Consistency**: Complete M/T/W/Th structured sessions

**Green Lights for Week 47**:
- Mon/Wed easy runs averaged 135-145 bpm
- Thu tempo completed 22min @ 158-165 bpm
- Tue 5x3min completed with progressive HR (160→172 across reps)
- No excessive fatigue, good sleep, normal energy

**Yellow Lights (adjust Week 47)**:
- Easy runs still 147+ bpm despite conscious effort
- Thu tempo consistently >170 bpm on climbs
- Tue intervals required Z4+ effort for final reps
- Extended fatigue beyond 48h post-quality

## Coach's Notes

Florian,

**Week 45 Analysis**:

**What went well**:
- ✅ Excellent structure consistency (M/T/W completed)
- ✅ Outstanding interval power progression (379W final rep!)
- ✅ Good mechanical execution (89.3 rpm cadence)
- ✅ Strong recovery between intervals (HR drops to 135-138 bpm)

**What needs immediate attention**:
- ⚠️ **Easy run HR discipline**: 3 consecutive days at 147-148 bpm (target 130-145)
- ⚠️ **Interval intensity confidence**: Conservative 156-163 bpm, but 379W proved capacity
- ⚠️ **Missed tempo session**: TOROclassic conflict understandable, but tempo critical for trail

**Thursday Context**: You noted "had to skip Thursday because in total classic workout" - understood! TOROclassic (58min @ 138 bpm) provided cross-training benefit but NOT same stimulus as sustained Z3 tempo. Tempo cannot be missed 2 weeks in row for trail preparation.

**Week 46 Priorities**:

**Priority #1 - Easy Run HR Discipline**:
You ran 3 consecutive days at 147-148 bpm when target is 130-145 bpm. This isn't sustainable for trail ultra base building. The solution is SIMPLE but requires mental acceptance: **RUN SLOWER**.

- Week 45: 5:19-5:24 min/km pace → 147-148 bpm
- Week 46 target: 5:45-6:15 min/km pace → 135-145 bpm

This will feel "too slow" because you're fit (you have 379W hill power!). But trail ultra success requires MASTERING slow running. 80% of your training must be this intensity. Start Week 46 Monday with 5:45-6:00 pace and DO NOT let ego push faster.

**Priority #2 - Complete Thursday Tempo**:
Missing Week 45 tempo (TOROclassic conflict) was circumstance. Missing Week 46 would compromise trail preparation. 22min sustained Z3 is your RACE EFFORT for 34km. Must complete.

**Priority #3 - Interval Intensity Confidence**:
Week 45 intervals were conservative (156-163 bpm vs 160-172 target). Your power outputs (328-379W, peak 569W) PROVE you're capable of higher intensity. Week 46's 5x3min = opportunity to commit to 165-172 bpm earlier (not just final rep).

**The Bigger Picture**:
You're 19 weeks from 34km with 1000m+ climbing. This is 3x longer than anything recent. Success requires:
- VOLUME of easy miles (need that HR discipline!)
- SUSTAINED tempo work (cannot skip tempos)
- HILL STRENGTH (intervals going well, continue progression)

Week 46 is where we build on Week 45's mechanical success while fixing the HR discipline issue. Trust that slower pace = correct training intensity.

Let's nail this week! 🏃‍♂️⛰️
