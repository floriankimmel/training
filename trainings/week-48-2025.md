## Detailed Workout Execution

### Tuesday Hill Intervals (6x3min @ Z3-Z4)

**W47 Analysis - The Fade Pattern**:
- Interval HRs: 164/159/159/155/161 bpm
- **Problem**: Dropped to 155 bpm (5-17 bpm below target) on interval 4
- **Recovery**: Final rep 161 bpm showed capacity returned
- **Power**: 244W avg stayed consistent despite HR fade
- **Diagnosis**: Mental commitment issue or leg fatigue, not cardiovascular

**W48 Execution Strategy**:
- **Terrain verification**: MUST be 2-3% gradient (check elevation gain >50m)
- **Rep 1-2**: 160-165 bpm confident start
- **Rep 3-4**: **CRITICAL - Don't fade!** Stay 165-170 bpm when tired
- **Rep 5-6**: 168-172 bpm demonstrate full capacity
- **Mental cue**: "W47 showed I have 244W power - match that with higher HR commitment"
- **Success metric**: At least 4 of 6 reps hitting 165-172 bpm target

**Why 6th rep matters**:
- 34km race = repeated climbing efforts for 3-4 hours
- Need to prove you can sustain quality when accumulated fatigue sets in
- W47's 5th rep recovered to 161 bpm - can you do it on 6th?

### Thursday Extended Tempo (25min @ Z3)

**W47 Success Foundation**:
- 22min completed after 2-week pause = breakthrough
- 4:52 min/km pace @ 294W power = strong execution
- Pace-based effort reliable even if HR data inconsistent

**W48 Extension Approach**:
- **First 20min**: Replicate W47's 22min effort (4:50-5:00 min/km)
- **Final 5min**: Demonstrate capacity to extend
- **Target**: 158-165 bpm sustained despite 3min longer duration
- **Rolling terrain**: 60-100m elevation (practice effort-based pacing)
- **Mental**: "I did 22min - 3 more minutes proves progression"
- **Success**: Completing 25min at sustained Z3 without blowing up

**Why this matters for 34km**:
- Race will require 3-4 hours of sustained Z2-Z3 effort
- Building from 22min → 25min → eventually 30-35min tempo blocks
- Mental practice for "one more interval" when tired

### Monday & Wednesday Easy Runs - The New Standard

**W47 MASTERY Demonstrated**:
- Mon: 138.4 bpm @ 6:02 pace
- Wed: 127.7 bpm @ 6:02 pace (EVEN BETTER!)
- Sun: 130.8 bpm @ 6:16 pace for 70min

**W48 Consistency Check**:
- **Goal**: Prove this isn't a fluke - replicate 130-145 bpm both days
- **Mon**: 130-145 bpm avg (accept 6:00-6:30 pace)
- **Wed**: 130-145 bpm avg (W47's 128 bpm is the gold standard)
- **Mental**: "I've done this 3x perfectly - it's who I am now"

**The 80/20 Rule for Trail**:
- 80% of trail training is Z1-Z2 easy running
- Your W47 execution (128-138 bpm) = perfect intensity for this 80%
- Maintaining this discipline over 17 weeks = race-day success

---

## Recovery Monitoring & Sleep Prioritization

### Weekly Sleep Target - CRITICAL FOCUS

**W47 Problem Identified**: Sleep inconsistency
- Wed: 5.3h (significantly short)
- Most nights: 6-7h (below 7-8h target)
- **Correlation**: Short sleep → low HRV next day

**W48 Sleep Protocol**:
- **Target**: 7-8 hours EVERY night
- **Bedtime consistency**: Same time nightly (circadian rhythm)
- **Sleep hygiene**:
  - Dark room, cool temp (16-18°C)
  - No screens 1h before bed
  - Wind-down routine (light reading, stretching)
- **Priority nights**:
  - Mon night (before Tue intervals)
  - Wed night (before Thu tempo)

### Daily Morning Checks

**Assessment before getting up**:
1. **RHR**: Compare to baseline (Good: 54-57 bpm)
2. **HRV** (if tracked): Note if <41ms
3. **Sleep quality**: Duration + subjective feel
4. **Subjective energy**: Mental alertness, physical readiness

**Decision Matrix**:
- **Green (RHR 54-57, good sleep)**: Execute plan as written
- **Yellow (RHR 58-59, moderate sleep)**: Complete sessions but monitor
- **Red (RHR ≥60, poor sleep)**: Consider reducing interval/tempo intensity

### Next-Day Recovery Indicators

**Monitor these patterns**:
- **Wed morning** (after Tue intervals): Should feel responsive, not heavy
- **Thu morning** (after Wed easy): Should feel fresh for tempo
- **Fri morning** (after Thu tempo): Some fatigue OK, but not depleted
- **Sat morning**: Should feel good enough for long run if desired

**W47 showed**: Your body handles training well when sleep is adequate. Focus on 7-8h and recovery will follow.

## Coach's Notes

Florian,

**Week 47 was OUTSTANDING!** 🎉

Let me highlight what you achieved:

**ALL Sessions Completed**:
- Monday: 138 bpm easy run (perfect Z1-Z2)
- Tuesday: 5x3min hill intervals (completed)
- Wednesday: 128 bpm easy run (EXCEPTIONAL - even better than Monday!)
- Thursday: 22min tempo (SUCCESS after 2-week pause!)
- Sunday: 70min long run @ 131 bpm (optional bonus - crushed it!)

**HR Discipline MASTERED**:
You've finally nailed easy running! Three perfect sessions:
- Mon: 138 bpm @ 6:02 pace
- Wed: 128 bpm @ 6:02 pace
- Sun: 131 bpm @ 6:16 pace

This is the breakthrough I've been pushing for since Week 45! You now understand that 128-138 bpm IS training, not "junk miles." This discipline is your foundation for 34km.

**Tempo Breakthrough**:
After missing 2 consecutive weeks (W45 TOROclassic conflict, W46 Kränklichkeit), you completed 22min sustained tempo! Whether the HR data was fully reliable or not, your pace execution (4:52 min/km) and power output (294W) show strong sustained capacity. This is your RACE PACE for Lindkogel.

**Long Run Success**:
The optional Sunday 70min run was a huge confidence builder. 11.2km @ 131 bpm shows you can extend duration while maintaining perfect aerobic discipline. This is exactly the foundation you need for 34km trail racing.

**The Tuesday Interval Analysis**:
Your hill intervals showed a mid-session fade pattern (164→159→159→155→161 bpm). Three observations:
1. **Power stayed consistent** (244W) - your legs were working fine
2. **You recovered** (161 bpm final rep) - you have the capacity
3. **Mental commitment** wavered mid-session when tired

Week 48's 6x3min will test your ability to maintain intensity through fatigue accumulation. The 6th rep is where you prove trail-race readiness - repeated climbing efforts when tired.

**Recovery Metrics Context**:
- **RHR**: Opened excellent (50 bpm!), slightly elevated early week (59-60 bpm), normalized by Saturday (54 bpm)
- **HRV**: Fluctuated with sleep quality (Wed 5.3h → Wed/Thu HRV low)
- **Sleep**: Inconsistent (5.3-7.5h) - this is your primary focus area
- **Training response**: Excellent - all sessions completed at good quality

**The sleep-HRV connection is clear**: When sleep was short (Wed 5.3h), HRV dropped next 2 days. When sleep was adequate (Mon 7.5h), HRV was good (57ms Tue). Your body handles training well when you give it 7-8h sleep.

**Week 48 Strategy**:

You're ready for progression:
1. **6x3min hills** - prove you can avoid mid-fade, finish strong on 6th rep
2. **25min tempo** - extend from 22min, demonstrate sustained capacity
3. **Maintain easy HR** - replicate 128-138 bpm, prove it's permanent
4. **Sleep prioritization** - 7-8h EVERY night, especially Mon/Wed before quality sessions

**The Big Picture**:
You've completed the 4-week base building phase exceptionally well:
- Weekly volume: 2.5h → 4.5h (80% increase)
- Easy HR discipline: Mastered (128-138 bpm standard)
- Tempo work: Reestablished (22min sustained)
- Long runs: Introduced (70min success)

Week 48 is the final base-building week before transitioning to endurance foundation phase (Weeks 49-52). Your mission: prove W47 wasn't a fluke, extend quality durations, maintain discipline.

**17 weeks to Lindkogel**: Your trajectory is excellent. The easy pace mastery, tempo restart, and 70min long run all show you're building the right foundation. Stay consistent, prioritize sleep, and trust the process.

Let's make Week 48 another breakthrough week! 💪🏃‍♂️⛰️
