# Week 04, 2026 - AGGRESSIVE INTERVAL RETURN + VOLUME

## Post-Corona Phase 4: Interval Return (Aggressive)

**Race**: Lindkogel Trail 2026 (March 22, 2026) - 34km mit 1000m+ elevation
**Weeks Until Race**: 9 Wochen
**Phase**: Post-Corona Recovery - Neuromuscular Activation Phase
**Current Week**: January 20-26, 2026

## Week 03 Analysis - CRITICAL LEARNING! 🚨

**Sessions Completed**:
- Di 13.01: Easy Run 35min @ 129 bpm avg, 7:17/km, 68m elev - **A+** (excellent)
- Mi 14.01: Hill Intervals 38:35 @ 135 bpm avg (!), 166 max - **B-** (structure✅, stimulus❌)

**W03 Totals**:
- **Volume**: 74min (2 runs, target 100-130min)
- **Quality attempted**: 3x2min hills BUT...

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Legs = Limiter, Not Cardio! ⚠️**

From Mi 14.01 feedback: *"Due to lack of quality sessions, my legs were much more a hindering factor than my cardio"*

**What This Means**:
- **HR low** (140-147 bpm intervals vs 165-174 target): NOT cold suppression
- **Reality**: Legs couldn't generate force to spike HR
- **Power decline**: 360W → 327W (-9%) = leg failure, not pacing
- **Neuromuscular deconditioning**: 5 weeks no quality = muscles not ready

**Recovery Metrics - W03**:

| Date | HRV (SDNN) | RHR | Sleep | Next-Day | Assessment |
|------|-----------|-----|-------|----------|------------|
| Jan 13 | 41.33ms ✅ | 59 ⚠️ | 433min ✅ | Di easy run | Ready |
| Jan 14 | 44.56ms ✅ | 59 ⚠️ | 416min ✅ | Mi hills | Ready but... |
| Jan 15 | 39.27ms ⚠️ | **64 🚨** | 423min ✅ | - | **Spiked post-hills!** |
| Jan 16 | 39.52ms ⚠️ | **63 🚨** | 434min ✅ | - | Still elevated |
| Jan 17 | 45.68ms ✅ | 55 ✅ | 423min ✅ | Weekend | **Recovered!** |

**Recovery Pattern Shows**:
- **RHR spiked 64-63** (Jan 15-16) = body reacted to hills
- **Recovered to 55** (Jan 17) = bounced back well
- **HRV stable** throughout = cardiovascular system fine
- **Verdict**: Legs overloaded, but recovery working

**Key Learnings from W03**:
1. **Neuromuscular ≠ Cardiovascular**: Cardio recovered fast, legs not ready
2. **Skipped Phase 2**: Went from easy runs (W01-02) → 2min Z4 intervals = TOO BIG JUMP
3. **Need progressive return**: 10sec → 20sec → 30sec → 60sec → 2min
4. **5 weeks no quality** = need neuromuscular activation BEFORE sustained efforts

---

## Week 04 Training Philosophy - AGGRESSIVE INTERVAL RETURN

**Priorität**: Return to threshold intervals with new Mon/Wed quality structure!

**Post-Corona Phase 4 Strategy (Aggressive)**:
- Volume: 145-155min (5 runs) - MANDATORY
- Quality: 2x interval sessions (Mon 4x 90sec + Wed 5x 90sec) @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)
- Recovery: Tue + Thu @ Z1 (120-140 bpm) - active recovery
- Rest: Friday (full recovery day)
- Easy run: Sunday (40-45min)
- Strength: 2x 30min (Mon + Wed evenings) - NON-NEGOTIABLE

**New Weekly Structure**:
- **Monday**: Quality #1 (intervals/tempo)
- **Tuesday**: Recovery run (flush legs)
- **Wednesday**: Quality #2 (main intervals)
- **Thursday**: Recovery run (prep for weekend)
- **Friday**: Rest from running (full recovery)
- **Saturday**: Unscheduled
- **Sunday**: Easy run (longer session)

**Why Intervals Now**:
- **Week 03 lesson**: 2min was too long, but we can try 90sec
- **Aggressive timeline**:
  - W01-02: Only easy (aerobic base) ✅
  - W03: Attempted 2-3x 2min intervals (legs failed) ⚠️
  - **W04**: 2x sessions (4x + 5x 90sec) ← WE ARE HERE
  - W05: 2x sessions (5x + 6x 2min) if W04 succeeds
  - W06: Race-specific threshold work
  - W07+: Trail-specific (long efforts, sustained hills)

**Key Differences vs. W03**:
- **TWO quality sessions**: Mon + Wed (distributed load)
- **Shorter intervals**: 90sec vs 2min = legs more likely to sustain
- **Recovery days**: Tue + Thu active recovery built in
- **Higher total volume**: 145-155min vs 74min = +96-109%
- **2x strength**: Aligned with quality days (Mon + Wed)

---

## Monday, January 20

- **Morning**: RHR/Recovery Check
  - Expected: RHR 55-58 bpm (should be recovered from W03)
  - HRV: 41+ ms preferred
  - Decision Matrix:
    - RHR <58 bpm + Energy >7/10 = GREEN → Quality session
    - RHR 58-60 bpm = YELLOW → Easy run only
    - RHR >60 bpm = RED → Rest day
- **Lunch**: **Hill Intervals #1** - 40min total
  - **Structure**:
    - 12min @ Z1 warmup (130-145 bpm)
    - **4x 90sec @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)** w/ 2:30min recovery jog between
    - 8min @ Z1 cool-down
  - **Target HR**: 160-167 bpm (Z4 threshold approach)
  - **Effort**: RPE 7-8/10 (controlled hard)
  - **Bailout**: If HR <155 bpm or legs failing → abort, switch to easy
  - **Purpose**: First quality session under new Mon/Wed structure
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min
  - Leg power focus (jump squats, Bulgarian splits, single-leg RDL, calf raises)
  - Core work

*NEW STRUCTURE: Monday = Quality Day #1*

---

## Tuesday, January 21

- **Morning**: Recovery Check post-Monday intervals
  - **Assess**: How did Mon intervals feel? DOMS? Movement quality?
  - **RHR**: Should stay <62 bpm (spike = overload from Mon)
  - Decision Matrix:
    - RHR <60 bpm + legs OK → 35min recovery
    - RHR 60-62 bpm = YELLOW → 25-30min easy
    - RHR >62 bpm = RED → Rest day
- **Lunch**: **Recovery Run** - 30-35min @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
  - **Target HR**: 120-140 bpm (EASY recovery!)
  - **Pace**: 6:00-7:00 min/km (slow = correct after Mon intervals!)
  - **Route**: FLAT, familiar
  - **Mental**: "Active recovery post-intervals - flush legs"
  - **Success**: Easy feel, HR stable, legs loosening
  - **CRITICAL**: This is RECOVERY, not training! Keep HR <140 bpm!
- **Evening**: Free

*NEW STRUCTURE: Tuesday = Recovery Day #1*

---

## Wednesday, January 22

- **Morning**: Recovery Check
  - **Critical**: Recovered from Mon intervals? RHR back to baseline?
  - RHR should be <60 bpm, Energy >7/10
  - Decision:
    - RHR <58 + legs good = GREEN → 5x 90sec as planned
    - RHR 58-60 + legs OK = YELLOW → 4x 90sec
    - RHR >60 OR legs tired = RED → Easy run only, NO intervals
- **Lunch**: **Hill Intervals #2 (MAIN SESSION)** - 45min total
  - **Structure**:
    - 15min @ Z1 warmup (130-145 bpm)
    - **5x 90sec @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)** w/ 2:30min recovery jog between
    - 10min @ Z1 cool-down
  - **Interval execution**:
    - **Target HR**: 160-167 bpm (Z4 threshold approach)
    - **Effort**: RPE 7-8/10 (controlled hard, NOT max)
    - **Focus**: Sustained power, consistent pace, uphill if possible
    - **Recovery**: 2:30min @ Z1 (130-140 bpm) between reps
    - **Key**: Push but stay controlled - if legs fail, back off
  - **Shorter than W03**: 90sec vs 2min = more manageable for legs
  - **More reps**: 5 vs 3 = maintain total quality volume
  - **Bailout**: If HR <155 bpm or legs failing → abort, switch to easy
  - **Total duration**: ~45min
  - **Purpose**: Main quality session - test if legs can sustain threshold
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min
  - **Leg Power Focus**:
    - Jump squats 3x8 (explosive!)
    - Bulgarian split squats 3x10 each leg
    - Single-leg RDL 3x10 each
    - Box step-ups 3x12 each
    - Calf raises 3x15
  - **Core**: Plank variations 3x 45s

*NEW STRUCTURE: Wednesday = Quality Day #2 (MAIN INTERVALS)*

---

## Thursday, January 23

- **Morning**: Recovery Check post-Wed intervals - CRITICAL!
  - **Assess**: How do legs feel? DOMS? Movement quality?
  - **RHR**: MUST be <62 bpm (spike = overload from 2 quality sessions)
  - **Decision**:
    - RHR <60 + legs OK → 35min recovery run
    - RHR 60-62 + legs tired → 25-30min easy
    - RHR >62 OR legs very sore → REST DAY
- **Lunch**: **Recovery Run** - 30-35min @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
  - **Target HR**: 120-140 bpm (EASY recovery!)
  - **Pace**: 6:00-7:00 min/km (slow = correct after 2 quality sessions!)
  - **Route**: FLAT, familiar
  - **Mental**: "Second recovery day - prepare for weekend"
  - **Success**: Easy feel, HR stable, legs responsive
  - **CRITICAL**: If HR drifting >140 or legs heavy → cut short!
- **Evening**: Free

*NEW STRUCTURE: Thursday = Recovery Day #2*

---

## Friday, January 24

- **Morning**: Recovery Check
  - **Assess**: How recovered from Mon + Wed intervals?
  - **RHR**: Check trend over week
  - **HRV**: Should be rebounding if recovering well
- **Lunch**: **Rest from running**
  - **Purpose**: Full recovery day post 2 quality sessions
  - **Mental**: "Let legs recover before weekend run"
  - **Active recovery**: Light walk 20-30min optional
- **Evening**: Free

*Rest day - recover from 2 quality + 2 recovery sessions*

---

## Weekend (Saturday Jan 25 - Sunday Jan 26)

### Saturday

- **No scheduled activities** - Weekend unplanned
- **Optional**: Light walk 20-30min
- **Focus**: Recovery prep für next week

*Rest day*

---

### Sunday

- **Morning**: **Easy Run** - 40-45min @ Z1 (130-145 bpm) - MANDATORY
  - **Decision criteria**:
    - RHR <60 bpm + recovered = GO for 40-45min
    - RHR 60-62 = reduce to 35-40min
    - RHR >62 OR extreme fatigue = 30min or rest
  - **Target HR**: 130-145 bpm
  - **Pace**: 5:45-6:30 min/km
  - **Route**: Flat or slightly rolling OK
  - **Mental**: "End-of-week run - showing volume consistency!"
  - **Purpose**: Complete volume target, prove body handling 2 quality + volume
- **Afternoon**: Family priority
- **Focus**: Prep für W05 (continue interval progression)

*Weekend run mandatory - longest run of week, proves recovery working*

---

## Backup Options & Flexibility

**Missed Tuesday**:
- Shift zu We (then: We run + optional strides, Do recovery)
- Or: We strides, Do recovery, Fr easy = 3 runs still success

**Missed Wednesday**:
- **WICHTIG**: Strides = key session this week!
- Shift zu Do (then: Do strides, Fr recovery)
- Or: Skip strides, focus volume (Di/Do/Fr easy)

**Missed Thursday**:
- Not critical (recovery run)
- Di + We + Fr = 3 runs OK

**Missed Friday**:
- Shift zu Sa (Sa lunch possible ausnahmsweise)
- Or: Weekend run becomes #3

**Wenn Strides zu hart fühlen**:
- Reduce to 4-5x 10sec (instead of 6-8x)
- Or: Skip strides, do Di/Do/Fr/Su easy = 4x easy runs
- **No panic**: Can retry strides W05

**Wenn Legs sehr sore from We strides**:
- Do + Fr: Both @ 30min max, HR <140 bpm
- Skip weekend run automatic
- W05: Repeat W04 structure (strides again)

## Recovery Protocol - NEUROMUSCULAR MONITORING

### Daily Morning Checks - ESSENTIAL

**Di/We/Fr morgens (vor run decision)**:
1. **RHR**: <58 bpm = GREEN, 58-60 = YELLOW, >60 = RED
2. **Subjektive Energie**: 1-10 Scale (>7 = GREEN)
3. **HRV wenn möglich**: >40 = GREEN, 37-40 = YELLOW, <37 = RED
4. **Sleep letzte Nacht**: >6.5h = GREEN
5. **Legs feel**: Fresh = GREEN, Tired = YELLOW, Sore = RED

**Do morgen (post-strides check) - CRITICAL**:
1. **Leg soreness**: 1-10 scale
   - 0-3 = Normal, proceed
   - 4-6 = Reduce Do to 30min
   - 7-10 = Rest day, strides too much
2. **Movement quality**: Stiff? Or loose?
3. **RHR**: Should stay <60 bpm (spike = overload)

### Decision Matrix W04

**GREEN LIGHT (Run as planned)**:
- RHR <58 bpm
- Energy >7/10
- HRV >40ms (if tracked)
- Sleep >6.5h
- Legs feel fresh
- → Easy run 35-40min @ 130-145 bpm OK

**YELLOW LIGHT (Modify)**:
- RHR 58-60 bpm
- Energy 6-7/10
- HRV 37-40ms
- Sleep 6-6.5h
- Legs slightly tired
- → Reduce zu 30min @ 130-140 bpm

**RED LIGHT (Very Easy or Rest)**:
- RHR >60 bpm
- Energy <6/10
- HRV <37ms
- Sleep <6h
- Legs sore/heavy (>6/10)
- → 25min @ 130-135 bpm OR rest day

### Neuromuscular-Specific Monitoring

**Post-Strides Assessment (Do morning)**:
- **Good signs**: Slight muscle awareness, feel "alive", no stiffness
- **Yellow flags**: DOMS 4-6/10, slower movement, slight stiffness
- **Red flags**: DOMS >6/10, can't move normally, extreme stiffness

**If DOMS too high** (>6/10):
- Do: Rest day
- Fr: Light 25min @ 130-135 bpm only
- Weekend: Rest
- **W05 plan**: Repeat W04 approach (6x 10sec again)

---

## Race-Specific Context

**Lindkogel Trail (9 Wochen out)** - Neuromuscular Prep Phase:

**Timeline Update**:
- **W01-02** (completed): Test + Restart ✅ PASSED
- **W03** (completed): Quality return attempted (legs not ready!) ⚠️
- **W04** (diese Woche): Neuromuscular activation - SHORT sprints
- **W05** (Jan 27+): Extend sprints (8x 20-30sec hills)
- **W06** (Feb 3+): Return intervals (4-6x 60-90sec @ Z4)
- **W07-08**: Build to 2-5min threshold work
- **W09-11**: Trail-specific (long runs, sustained hills, vertical)
- **W12**: Taper begin
- **W13**: RACE (March 22)

**Why This Timeline Works**:
- **Phase 2 (W04)**: Neural activation = prepare legs for load
- **Phase 3 (W05)**: Short hills = bridge to sustained efforts
- **Phase 4 (W06+)**: Interval return = cardiovascular + legs both ready
- **9 weeks left**: 2 weeks neuro prep + 5 weeks quality + 2 taper = PERFECT

**Math Check**:
- Standard neuro return: 2-3 weeks
- Quality build: 4-6 weeks needed for 34km trail
- Taper: 2 weeks standard
- **Total**: 8-11 weeks = we have 9 = RIGHT ON TRACK!

---

## Week 04 Success Metrics - AGGRESSIVE APPROACH

**Must-Achieve (Top 3 Priorities)**:

1. **Complete BOTH Interval Sessions (Mon + Wed)**
   - Mon: 4x 90sec @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
   - Wed: 5x 90sec @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
   - Hit target HR zone (>155 bpm minimum) on BOTH days
   - Total 9 reps @ threshold
   - **Success = legs can sustain threshold efforts across multiple sessions!**

2. **Volume Target (5 Runs MANDATORY)**
   - Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Su all required
   - Recovery runs (Tue/Thu) @ 120-140 bpm strict
   - Easy run (Su) @ 130-145 bpm
   - Friday REST day
   - Total 145-155min volume minimum
   - **Success = volume + 2x quality compatible!**

3. **Recovery Management Between Quality Sessions**
   - RHR stays <62 bpm on Tue morning (post-Mon)
   - RHR stays <62 bpm on Thu morning (post-Wed)
   - Can complete both recovery runs
   - No extreme DOMS (>7/10)
   - **Success = body recovering from distributed quality load!**

**Nice-to-Have**:
- HR hits 160-167 bpm on all 9 total intervals
- 2x strength sessions done (Mon + Wed evenings)
- Sleep 7h+ most nights (5+ nights)
- Both interval sessions feel "strong" not "struggling"

### Green Lights für W05 (Continue Interval Progression)

✅ **BOTH interval sessions completed**: Mon 4x + Wed 5x @ 160-167 bpm
✅ **Recovery managed**: RHR <62 bpm both Tue + Thu mornings
✅ **Volume achieved**: 145-155min total (5 runs)
✅ **HR response good**: Hit 160+ bpm on 7+ of 9 intervals
✅ **Legs sustained efforts**: Not failing mid-interval like W03
✅ **Recovery runs effective**: Tue + Thu completed comfortably

**Wenn 5+ green lights** → W05 extend to 2min intervals (Mon 5x + Wed 6x 2min)

### Yellow Lights (Repeat Interval Structure)

⚠️ **Only 1 quality session**: Skipped Mon OR Wed intervals
⚠️ **Volume low**: <140min total or <4 runs
⚠️ **HR below target**: <155 bpm on multiple intervals (legs failing)
⚠️ **DOMS severe**: >7/10 soreness, couldn't do 2nd quality session
⚠️ **RHR elevated**: >62 bpm for 2+ consecutive days

**Wenn 2+ yellow lights** → W05 repeat W04 structure (4x + 5x 90sec again)

### Red Lights (Back to Single Quality Session)

🚨 **<4 runs completed**: Couldn't manage volume + 2 quality
🚨 **Extreme fatigue**: Can't complete recovery runs
🚨 **RHR elevated**: >64 bpm persistent
🚨 **HRV crashed**: <35ms all week
🚨 **Injury from intervals**: Muscle strain, tendon issue

**Wenn 1+ red lights** → W05 drop to 1 quality session per week OR neuro prep

## Coach's Notes - AGGRESSIVE APPROACH

**Shifting Strategy: Skip Neuro Prep, Return to Intervals Immediately** ⚡

### What We're Doing Differently

**Original Plan (conservative)**:
- W04: Neuromuscular prep (10sec strides)
- W05: Extend to 20-30sec sprints
- W06: Return to intervals

**New Plan (aggressive)**:
- W04: Return to intervals NOW (5x 90sec @ Z4)
- W05: Extend to 2min intervals
- W06: Race-specific work

### Rationale for Aggressive Approach

**Why This Might Work**:
- 9 weeks to race = tight timeline
- W03 showed cardio ready, just legs struggling
- Shorter intervals (90sec vs 2min) = more manageable
- More reps (5 vs 3) = maintain stimulus
- Higher volume (135-145min) = better base

**Risks to Monitor**:
- Legs may still not be ready (W03 just happened)
- Injury risk higher without neuro prep phase
- Recovery demand much higher than strides would be
- If intervals fail again, we've lost 2 weeks

### Why Legs Weren't Ready

**Timeline**:
- Corona-Pause: ~3 weeks off
- W01-02: Only easy running (correct!)
- W03: Jumped to 2min Z4 intervals (TOO BIG JUMP!)

**Neuromuscular vs. Cardiovascular**:
- **Cardio**: Recovers fast (2-3 weeks easy = 80-90% back)
- **Neuro**: Decays FASTER, returns SLOWER (needs progressive loading)
- Your easy runs showed: Cardio WORKS (5:33/km @ 140 bpm = excellent!)
- But: Legs can't sustain high force yet = need activation phase

**Classic Post-Illness Pattern**:
- Weeks 1-2: Both systems weak → easy only ✅
- **Weeks 3-4**: Cardio recovered → TEMPTING to push hard ← YOU ARE HERE!
- Weeks 5-6: Legs still weak → injury risk if too fast
- **Solution**: INSERT neuromuscular prep phase (W04-05) BEFORE returning intervals

### W04 Strategy - AGGRESSIVE INTERVAL RETURN

**Intervals with modifications from W03**:
- **We: 5x 90sec @ Z4** (shorter than W03's 2min)
- Di/Do/Fr/Su: 4 easy runs @ Z1 (volume push!)
- 2x Strength: Leg power work
- **Total**: 135-145min volume

**Why 90sec Intervals**:
- **Shorter duration**: 90sec vs 2min = legs more likely to hold power
- **More reps**: 5 vs 3 = same total quality time (~7.5min)
- **Threshold stimulus**: Still gets HR to 160-167 bpm
- **Progressive**: 90sec (W04) → 2min (W05) → 3min (W06)

**Key Success Criteria**:
- **HR response**: MUST hit 160+ bpm on intervals (vs W03's 140-147)
- **Power sustained**: No dramatic decline rep to rep
- **Subjective feel**: Legs driving effort, not just cardio
- **Recovery**: RHR stays <62 bpm next day

**If This Fails**:
- Same pattern as W03 (HR <155, legs failing) = STOP
- Abort intervals mid-session, switch to easy
- W05: Switch to neuromuscular prep (strides)
- Accept we need the progressive buildup

### Aggressive Timeline! ⏰

**9 Wochen bis Lindkogel**:

**Interval Return (W04-05)**: 2 weeks
- W04: 5x 90sec @ Z4 (test if legs ready)
- W05: 5-6x 2min @ Z4 (extend duration)

**Quality Build (W06-08)**: 3 weeks
- W06: 4-5x 3min @ Z4 (race-specific threshold)
- W07: Long tempo 20-25min @ Z3-Z4
- W08: Hill-specific (sustained climbs, vertical)

**Trail Specific (W09-11)**: 3 weeks
- Long runs extend 60-90min
- Sustained hill efforts 30-40min
- Back-to-back weekends
- Vertical accumulation 500-800m

**Taper (W12)**: 1 week
- Reduce volume 40%
- Maintain intensity (2x short quality)

**RACE (W13)**: March 22! 🏔️

**Aggressive Math**:
- Interval return: 2 weeks (W04-05)
- Quality build: 3 weeks (W06-08)
- Trail-specific: 3 weeks (W09-11)
- Taper: 1 week (W12)
- **Total**: 9 weeks = gains 1 week vs conservative plan

### Recovery Metrics - What To Watch

**W03 Showed**:
- RHR spiked 64 (Jan 15) after hills = body reacted
- But: Recovered to 55 (Jan 17) = bounced back well
- HRV stayed 39-46ms = cardiovascular system fine

**W04 Expected (Aggressive Intervals)**:
- Bigger RHR bump after We intervals (60-62 bpm) = EXPECTED
- Should recover by Fr-Sa (56-58 bpm)
- HRV may dip Do-Fr (35-40ms) then rebound weekend
- Sleep CRITICAL: 7h+ most nights = aim 5+ nights @ 420min+
- DOMS moderate (4-6/10) expected

**When To Worry**:
- RHR >64 bpm for 2+ days = too much
- HRV <33ms for 3+ days = severe overload
- DOMS >8/10 from intervals = injury risk
- Can't complete easy runs @ <145 bpm = excessive fatigue
- Same HR pattern as W03 (140-147 on intervals) = legs still not ready

### Strength Training Priority! 💪

**2x This Week = NON-NEGOTIABLE**:
- We evening + Fr evening (or Fr + Sa)
- **Why critical**: Legs need POWER for hills
- Jump squats = explosive force
- Single-leg work = stability + balance
- Calf raises = push-off power

**Hill racing = leg strength sport**:
- 34km + 1000m elevation = LOTS of vertical force
- Cardio alone won't cut it
- Need: Powerful legs + stable ankles + strong core

### Die Wichtigste Message 💯

**W04 Erfolg = Intervals completed + 4 runs, 135min+ total**

**JA**:
- 1x quality: 5x 90sec @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target HIT!)
- 4x runs @ 35-40min each (Di/We/Fr/Su)
- 2x strength 30min (legs!)
- Total 135-145min
- HR 160+ on intervals (legs sustaining effort!)
- Feel "worked" but recovering

**NEIN**:
- HR <155 bpm on intervals = abort, switch to easy
- Skipping recovery runs (all 4 runs mandatory!)
- "Pushing through" if DOMS >8/10 or RHR >64
- Ignoring leg failure signals

**Aggressive Interval Progression**:
- W04: 5x 90sec @ Z4 (test if legs ready)
- W05: 5-6x 2min @ Z4 (extend if W04 succeeds)
- W06: 4-5x 3min @ Z4 (full threshold)
- W07: Race-specific (long efforts, hills)

### Your Honesty = Training Gold! 🙏

**"Legs were limiting factor" = THE most valuable feedback**:
- Objective data alone (360W power!) would've misled us
- We would've thought: "Great! Push harder!"
- Reality: "Legs not ready, need prep!"

**Keep This Communication**:
- Subjective feel > metrics sometimes
- "Legs felt X" = critical info
- Don't hide struggles = helps me plan better

### Practical Tips 🎯

**We Intervals (45min total)**:
- 15min easy warmup (CRITICAL - don't start cold!)
- Interval execution:
  - **90sec @ Z4**: Target 160-167 bpm (RPE 7-8/10)
  - **Focus**: Sustained power, controlled effort, uphill if possible
  - **Monitor HR**: Should hit 160+ by 60sec mark
  - **If HR <155**: Legs failing again - abort session, switch to easy
  - **Recovery**: 2:30min @ Z1 jog (130-140 bpm)
- 5 reps: Complete all 5 unless legs failing
- 10min easy cooldown
- **Key difference from W03**: Shorter (90 vs 120sec) = more manageable

**Do Recovery Run (30-35min)**:
- **CRITICAL**: HR <140 bpm ENTIRE run
- **Expect DOMS**: 4-6/10 normal, >7/10 = too much
- **Pace**: 6:00-7:00 min/km (slow = correct after intervals!)
- **Purpose**: Active recovery, flush legs
- **Abort if**: HR spiking >145 or legs extremely heavy

**Strength Sessions (30min)**:
- **Explosive work**: Jump squats = CRITICAL (power for intervals)
- **Unilateral**: Single-leg RDL + split squats = stability
- **2x this week = NON-NEGOTIABLE**: Foundation for race

### Final Call To Action ✅

**Diese Woche Must-Do (AGGRESSIVE + NEW STRUCTURE)**:
1. Morning checks Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Su - RHR <62 mandatory!
2. **Mon intervals 4x 90sec @ 160-167 bpm** - first test!
3. **Tue recovery run** - flush legs @ 120-140 bpm
4. **Wed intervals 5x 90sec @ 160-167 bpm** - main session!
5. **Thu recovery run** - prepare for weekend
6. **Fri REST** - full recovery day
7. **Su easy run 40-45min** - longest run of week
8. 5 runs total (Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Su) - ALL MANDATORY
9. Total 145-155min volume
10. 2x strength (Mon + Wed evenings!)
11. Sleep 7h+ (aim 5+ nights)
12. **Abort intervals if HR <155** - same as W03 = not ready yet

**If successful (BOTH quality sessions HR 160+, 5 runs, 145min+)** → W05: Mon 5x + Wed 6x 2min
**If yellow (1 quality completed, 4 runs, 135-144min)** → W05: repeat Mon 4x + Wed 5x 90sec
**If red (<4 runs, can't do 2 quality sessions)** → W05: drop to 1 quality/week OR neuro prep

**This Is The Test: Can Body Handle 2 Quality Sessions/Week?**

**If YES** → New Mon/Wed structure works, aggressive timeline on track
**If NO** → Need to build up to 2x quality OR stick with 1x quality

**New structure = distributed load, better recovery between quality. BUT still aggressive post-corona!** ⚠️💪

Let's test the new structure! 🔥

## Heart Rate Zone Quick Reference

**Diese Woche Z1 + Z5 (brief)**:
- **Z1**: 120-146 bpm (TARGET: 130-145 bpm for easy runs)
- **Z5**: 174-180 bpm (brief spikes during 10sec strides - OK!)

**Week 04 Zone Distribution**:
- 95% @ Z1 (easy running + warmup/cooldown)
- 5% @ Z5 (brief spikes during 6-8x 10sec strides)
- **Key**: Volume easy, quality SHORT and FAST

## Week 05 Preview

*Assuming successful Week 04 (intervals completed + 135min+ total):*

**Continue Interval Progression** 🔥:
- **We**: Hill intervals 5-6x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm) - extend duration
- **Fr**: Easy run 40min @ Z1
- **Di + Do**: Easy runs 40min @ Z1
- **Weekend**: Easy 40min mandatory
- **Total**: 145-155min
- **Strength**: 2x 30min (continue leg power focus)

**Goals**:
- Extend interval duration (90sec → 2min)
- Maintain volume 145-155min
- Build toward W06 race-specific work
- Prove legs can sustain threshold efforts

**Focus**:
- Threshold development (2min efforts)
- Volume consistency (4 runs mandatory)
- Progressive interval loading

*Wenn W04 schwierig war: Repeat W04 structure (5x 90sec again) in W05!*
