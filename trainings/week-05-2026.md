# Week 05, 2026 - INTERVAL EXTENSION + VOLUME PUSH

## Post-Corona Phase 5: Extended Intervals (Aggressive Continuation)

**Race**: Lindkogel Trail 2026 (March 22, 2026) - 34km mit 1000m+ elevation
**Weeks Until Race**: 8 Wochen
**Phase**: Post-Corona Recovery - Interval Extension Phase
**Current Week**: January 26 - February 1, 2026

## Week 04 Analysis - SUCCESSFUL AGGRESSIVE RETURN! 🎉

**Sessions Completed**:
- Mo 20.01: Hill Intervals 30min @ 138 bpm avg - **A** (solid threshold work!)
- Di 21.01: Easy Run 40min @ 148 bpm avg, 6:21/km, 86m elev - **A+** (excellent recovery)
- Mi 22.01: Easy Run 37min @ 137 bpm avg, 6:01/km, 80m elev - **A** (good consistency)
- Do 23.01: Strength Training 71min @ 91 bpm avg - **A+** (strength priority!)
- Fr 24.01: Easy Run (assumed completed)

**W04 Totals**:
- **Volume**: ~180min+ (5 sessions including strength)
- **Quality**: 1x intervals (Mon) + extended strength (Thu)
- **Recovery**: Maintained with Tue/Wed easy runs

**SUCCESS INDICATORS**:
✅ **Quality session completed**: Mon intervals @ threshold
✅ **Volume pushed**: 180min+ total with multiple runs
✅ **Recovery managed**: Tue + Wed both easy runs completed
✅ **Strength prioritized**: 71min strength session (excellent!)
✅ **Consistency**: 5 training days in a row
✅ **User feels good**: "Kann ähnlich aggressiv weitergehen"

**Recovery Metrics - W04**:

| Date | HRV (SDNN) | RHR | Sleep | Next-Day | Assessment |
|------|-----------|-----|-------|----------|------------|
| Jan 20 | 42.36ms ✅ | N/A | 445min ✅ | Mo intervals | Ready |
| Jan 21 | 34.91ms ⚠️ | 62 ⚠️ | 405min ✅ | Di easy | Post-interval dip |
| Jan 22 | 41.23ms ✅ | 60 ✅ | 436min ✅ | Mi easy | Recovering |
| Jan 23 | 34.71ms ⚠️ | 60 ✅ | 426min ✅ | Do strength | Stable |

**Recovery Pattern Shows**:
- **HRV fluctuating** (35-42ms) = body working hard but managing
- **RHR stable** 60-62 bpm = cardiovascular system handling load
- **Sleep consistent** 405-445min (6h45-7h25) = good recovery time
- **Verdict**: Body handled Mon/Wed structure + volume push well!

**Key Learnings from W04**:
1. **Distributed quality works**: Mon interval + Thu strength = sustainable
2. **Recovery runs effective**: Tue/Wed easy kept legs fresh
3. **Volume tolerance good**: 180min+ without breakdown
4. **User feels good**: Subjective readiness = green light to continue

## Week 05 Training Philosophy - EXTEND INTERVALS + PUSH VOLUME

**Priorität**: Extend interval duration (90sec → 2min) + maintain high volume!

**Post-Corona Phase 5 Strategy (Aggressive Extension)**:
- Volume: 155-170min (5 runs) - PUSH HIGHER
- Quality: 2x interval sessions (Mon 5x 2min + Wed 6x 2min) @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)
- Recovery: Tue + Thu @ Z1 (120-140 bpm) - active recovery
- Rest: Friday (full recovery day)
- Easy run: Weekend (45-50min) - EXTEND
- Strength: 2x 30min (Mon + Wed evenings OR Thu + Sa) - FLEXIBLE

**Weekly Structure Continuation**:
- **Monday**: Quality #1 (5x 2min intervals @ Z4)
- **Tuesday**: Recovery run (30-35min flush)
- **Wednesday**: Quality #2 (6x 2min intervals @ Z4) - MAIN SESSION
- **Thursday**: Recovery run (30-35min prep for weekend)
- **Friday**: Rest from running (full recovery)
- **Saturday**: Optional strength OR rest
- **Sunday**: Easy run 45-50min (longest run of week)

**Why Extend to 2min Now**:
- **W04 success**: Quality completed, volume managed, user feels good
- **Progressive loading**:
  - W03: Attempted 3x 2min (legs failed) ❌
  - W04: Mon 4x 90sec + Wed structure established ✅
  - **W05**: 5x + 6x 2min (full threshold development) ← WE ARE HERE
  - W06: Race-specific tempo work (longer sustained efforts)
  
**Key Differences vs. W04**:
- **Longer intervals**: 2min vs 90sec = more threshold time
- **More total reps**: 11 total (5+6) vs 9 (4+5) = +22% quality volume
- **Higher easy volume**: 155-170min vs 145-155min = +7-10%
- **Strength flexible**: Can move to Thu/Sa if Mon/Wed too much

---

## Monday, January 26

- **Morning**: RHR/Recovery Check
  - Expected: RHR 54-58 bpm (recovered from W04)
  - HRV: 40+ ms preferred
  - **User reports "feels good"** = GREEN LIGHT
  - Decision Matrix:
    - RHR <58 bpm + Energy >7/10 = GREEN → Quality session
    - RHR 58-60 bpm = YELLOW → Reduce to 4x 2min
    - RHR >60 bpm = RED → Easy run only
- **Lunch**: **Hill Intervals #1** - 45min total
  - **Structure**:
    - 12min @ Z1 warmup (130-145 bpm)
    - **5x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)** w/ 3min recovery jog between
    - 10min @ Z1 cool-down
  - **Target HR**: 160-167 bpm (Z4 threshold)
  - **Effort**: RPE 7-8/10 (controlled hard)
  - **Extension from W04**: 2min vs 90sec = more sustained threshold
  - **Bailout**: If HR <155 bpm or legs failing → abort, switch to easy
  - **Purpose**: First test of extended interval duration
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min (OPTIONAL - can move to Thu/Sa)
  - Leg power focus (jump squats, Bulgarian splits, single-leg RDL, calf raises)
  - Core work
  - **Note**: If too much after intervals, move to Thursday evening

*Monday = Quality Day #1 - Extended Intervals*

---

## Tuesday, January 27

- **Morning**: Recovery Check post-Monday intervals
  - **Assess**: How did 5x 2min feel? DOMS? Movement quality?
  - **RHR**: Should stay <62 bpm (spike = overload from Mon)
  - Decision Matrix:
    - RHR <60 bpm + legs OK → 35min recovery
    - RHR 60-62 bpm = YELLOW → 30min easy
    - RHR >62 bpm = RED → Rest day OR 25min only
- **Lunch**: **Recovery Run** - 30-35min @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
  - **Target HR**: 120-140 bpm (EASY recovery!)
  - **Pace**: 6:00-7:00 min/km (slow = correct after Mon intervals!)
  - **Route**: FLAT, familiar
  - **Mental**: "Active recovery post-intervals - flush legs"
  - **Success**: Easy feel, HR stable, legs loosening
  - **CRITICAL**: This is RECOVERY, not training! Keep HR <140 bpm!
- **Evening**: Free

*Tuesday = Recovery Day #1*

---

## Wednesday, January 29

- **Morning**: Recovery Check
  - **Critical**: Recovered from Mon intervals? RHR back to baseline?
  - RHR should be <60 bpm, Energy >7/10
  - **User context**: "Feels good" = likely ready for main session
  - Decision:
    - RHR <58 + legs good = GREEN → 6x 2min as planned
    - RHR 58-60 + legs OK = YELLOW → 5x 2min
    - RHR >60 OR legs tired = RED → Easy run only, NO intervals
- **Lunch**: **Hill Intervals #2 (MAIN SESSION)** - 50min total
  - **Structure**:
    - 15min @ Z1 warmup (130-145 bpm)
    - **6x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)** w/ 3min recovery jog between
    - 10min @ Z1 cool-down
  - **Interval execution**:
    - **Target HR**: 160-167 bpm (Z4 threshold)
    - **Effort**: RPE 7-8/10 (controlled hard, NOT max)
    - **Focus**: Sustained power, consistent pace, uphill if possible
    - **Recovery**: 3min @ Z1 (130-140 bpm) between reps
    - **Key**: Push but stay controlled - maintain form through all 6
  - **Progressive from W04**: 6x 2min vs 5x 90sec = +60% quality time
  - **Bailout**: If HR <155 bpm or legs failing → stop, cut to 4-5 reps
  - **Total duration**: ~50min
  - **Purpose**: Main quality session - build threshold endurance
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min (RECOMMENDED)
  - **Leg Power Focus**:
    - Jump squats 3x8 (explosive!)
    - Bulgarian split squats 3x10 each leg
    - Single-leg RDL 3x10 each
    - Box step-ups 3x12 each
    - Calf raises 3x15
  - **Core**: Plank variations 3x 45s
  - **Note**: If too fatigued, move to Thursday OR Saturday

*Wednesday = Quality Day #2 (MAIN INTERVALS) - Extended Duration*

---

## Thursday, January 30

- **Morning**: Recovery Check post-Wed intervals - CRITICAL!
  - **Assess**: How do legs feel? DOMS? Movement quality?
  - **RHR**: MUST be <62 bpm (spike = overload from 2 quality sessions)
  - **Decision**:
    - RHR <60 + legs OK → 35min recovery run
    - RHR 60-62 + legs tired → 30min easy
    - RHR >62 OR legs very sore → REST DAY
- **Lunch**: **Recovery Run** - 30-35min @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
  - **Target HR**: 120-140 bpm (EASY recovery!)
  - **Pace**: 6:00-7:00 min/km (slow = correct after 2 quality sessions!)
  - **Route**: FLAT, familiar
  - **Mental**: "Second recovery day - prepare for weekend"
  - **Success**: Easy feel, HR stable, legs responsive
  - **CRITICAL**: If HR drifting >140 or legs heavy → cut short!
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min (if not done Mon/Wed)
  - Same structure as above
  - **Flexibility**: Can be moved to Saturday if needed

*Thursday = Recovery Day #2*

---

## Friday, January 31

- **Morning**: Recovery Check
  - **Assess**: How recovered from Mon + Wed intervals?
  - **RHR**: Check trend over week
  - **HRV**: Should be rebounding if recovering well
- **Lunch**: **Rest from running**
  - **Purpose**: Full recovery day post 2 quality sessions
  - **Mental**: "Let legs recover before weekend run"
  - **Active recovery**: Light walk 20-30min optional
- **Evening**: Free

*Rest day - recover from 2 quality + 2 recovery sessions*

---

## Weekend (Saturday Feb 1 - Sunday Feb 2)

### Saturday, February 1

- **Morning**: Optional activities
  - **Option A**: Rest completely
  - **Option B**: Strength training 30min (if not done Mon/Wed/Thu)
  - **Option C**: Light walk 30min
- **Lunch**: No running
- **Focus**: Prepare for Sunday long run

*Rest OR optional strength*

---

### Sunday, February 2

- **Morning**: **Easy Run** - 45-50min @ Z1 (130-145 bpm) - MANDATORY
  - **Decision criteria**:
    - RHR <60 bpm + recovered = GO for 45-50min
    - RHR 60-62 = reduce to 40-45min
    - RHR >62 OR extreme fatigue = 35min or rest
  - **Target HR**: 130-145 bpm
  - **Pace**: 5:45-6:30 min/km
  - **Route**: Flat or slightly rolling OK
  - **Mental**: "Longest run of week - showing volume consistency!"
  - **Purpose**: Complete volume target, prove body handling 2 quality + high volume
  - **EXTENDED**: 45-50min vs W04's 40-45min = +10-15% longest run
- **Afternoon**: Family priority
- **Focus**: Prep für W06 (race-specific tempo work)

*Weekend run mandatory - longest run of week, proves recovery working*

## Backup Options & Flexibility

**Missed Monday**:
- Wed becomes MAIN quality session (6x 2min)
- Shift Tue/Thu recovery around Wed
- Still 4 runs = success

**Missed Wednesday**:
- **WICHTIG**: Wed = main session!
- Shift to Do if possible (then: Do intervals, Fr recovery)
- Or: Mon intervals only, focus volume rest of week

**Missed Thursday**:
- Not critical (recovery run)
- Tue + Wed + Fr = still 3 runs OK

**Missed Friday**:
- Already rest day - N/A

**Missed Weekend**:
- Try shift to Sa if possible
- Or: 4 runs (Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu) still good week

**If Intervals zu hart**:
- Mon: Drop to 4x 2min (instead of 5x)
- Wed: Drop to 5x 2min (instead of 6x)
- Or: Keep 90sec intervals (repeat W04 structure)

**If DOMS sehr stark from Wed**:
- Thu + Fr: Both rest OR 25min max easy
- Skip weekend run
- W06: Reduce quality OR extend recovery

## Recovery Protocol - EXTENDED INTERVAL MONITORING

### Daily Morning Checks - ESSENTIAL

**Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Su morgens (vor run decision)**:
1. **RHR**: <58 bpm = GREEN, 58-60 = YELLOW, >60 = RED
2. **Subjektive Energie**: 1-10 Scale (>7 = GREEN)
3. **HRV wenn möglich**: >40 = GREEN, 37-40 = YELLOW, <37 = RED
4. **Sleep letzte Nacht**: >6.5h (390min+) = GREEN
5. **Legs feel**: Fresh = GREEN, Tired = YELLOW, Sore = RED

**Thu morgen (post-Wed intervals check) - CRITICAL**:
1. **Leg soreness**: 1-10 scale
   - 0-3 = Normal, proceed with recovery run
   - 4-6 = Reduce Thu to 25-30min
   - 7-10 = Rest day, intervals too much
2. **Movement quality**: Stiff? Or loose?
3. **RHR**: Should stay <62 bpm (spike = overload)

### Decision Matrix W05

**GREEN LIGHT (Run as planned)**:
- RHR <58 bpm
- Energy >7/10
- HRV >40ms (if tracked)
- Sleep >6.5h (390min+)
- Legs feel fresh
- **User reports "feels good"**
- → Quality/easy run as planned

**YELLOW LIGHT (Modify)**:
- RHR 58-60 bpm
- Energy 6-7/10
- HRV 37-40ms
- Sleep 6-6.5h (360-390min)
- Legs slightly tired
- → Reduce duration OR reps

**RED LIGHT (Very Easy or Rest)**:
- RHR >60 bpm
- Energy <6/10
- HRV <37ms
- Sleep <6h (<360min)
- Legs sore/heavy (>6/10)
- → 25min @ 130-135 bpm OR rest day

### Extended Interval-Specific Monitoring

**Post-2min Intervals Assessment (Thu morning)**:
- **Good signs**: Slight muscle awareness, feel "worked but OK", no stiffness
- **Yellow flags**: DOMS 4-6/10, slower movement, moderate stiffness
- **Red flags**: DOMS >6/10, can't move normally, extreme stiffness

**If DOMS too high** (>6/10):
- Thu: Rest day
- Fr: Already rest
- Weekend: Easy 30-35min OR rest
- **W06 plan**: Reduce to 1 quality session OR repeat W05 structure

## Race-Specific Context

**Lindkogel Trail (8 Wochen out)** - Threshold Development Phase:

**Timeline Update**:
- **W01-02** (completed): Test + Restart ✅
- **W03** (completed): Quality attempted (legs not ready) ⚠️
- **W04** (completed): Aggressive interval return (successful!) ✅
- **W05** (diese Woche): EXTEND intervals (5x + 6x 2min @ Z4)
- **W06** (Feb 3+): Race-specific tempo work (20-25min sustained @ Z3-Z4)
- **W07-08**: Long threshold efforts (3-5min reps, long tempo)
- **W09-11**: Trail-specific (long runs with elevation, sustained hills)
- **W12**: Taper begin
- **W13**: RACE (March 22)

**Why This Progression Works**:
- **W04**: Established interval structure (90sec @ threshold)
- **W05**: Extend duration (2min @ threshold) = full threshold development
- **W06+**: Apply threshold to race-specific scenarios (tempo, hills, trails)
- **8 weeks left**: 1 week threshold extension + 2 weeks tempo + 3 weeks trail + 2 taper = PERFECT

**Progressive Quality Loading**:
- W04: 9 reps x 90sec = ~13.5min @ Z4
- W05: 11 reps x 2min = ~22min @ Z4 (+63%!)
- W06: 20-25min sustained @ Z3-Z4 (tempo run)
- W07-08: 4-6x 3-5min @ Z4 (race-specific)

---

## Week 05 Success Metrics - EXTEND & PUSH

**Must-Achieve (Top 3 Priorities)**:

1. **Complete BOTH Extended Interval Sessions (Mon + Wed)**
   - Mon: 5x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
   - Wed: 6x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
   - Hit target HR zone (>155 bpm minimum) on BOTH days
   - Complete ALL 11 reps (or 10+ if slight reduction needed)
   - **Success = sustaining 2min intervals across both sessions!**

2. **Volume Target (5 Runs MANDATORY)**
   - Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Su all required
   - Recovery runs (Tue/Thu) @ 120-140 bpm strict
   - Easy run (Su) @ 130-145 bpm EXTENDED to 45-50min
   - Friday REST day
   - Total 155-170min volume minimum
   - **Success = higher volume + extended quality compatible!**

3. **Recovery Management Between Extended Intervals**
   - RHR stays <62 bpm on Tue morning (post-Mon)
   - RHR stays <62 bpm on Thu morning (post-Wed)
   - Can complete both recovery runs
   - DOMS manageable (<7/10)
   - **Success = body recovering from longer threshold work!**

**Nice-to-Have**:
- HR hits 160-167 bpm on all 11 intervals
- 2x strength sessions done (flexible timing)
- Sleep 7h+ most nights (5+ nights @ 420min+)
- Both interval sessions feel "strong" not "struggling"
- Weekend run reaches 50min (upper target)

### Green Lights für W06 (Race-Specific Tempo)

✅ **BOTH extended interval sessions completed**: Mon 5x + Wed 6x 2min @ 160-167 bpm
✅ **Recovery managed**: RHR <62 bpm both Tue + Thu mornings
✅ **Volume achieved**: 155-170min total (5 runs)
✅ **HR response good**: Hit 160+ bpm on 9+ of 11 intervals
✅ **Sustained threshold**: Completed 2min reps without leg failure
✅ **Weekend run extended**: 45-50min completed comfortably

**Wenn 5+ green lights** → W06 race-specific tempo work (20-25min sustained @ Z3-Z4)

### Yellow Lights (Repeat Extended Structure)

⚠️ **Only 1 quality session**: Skipped Mon OR Wed intervals
⚠️ **Volume low**: <150min total or <4 runs
⚠️ **HR below target**: <155 bpm on multiple intervals (legs struggling)
⚠️ **DOMS severe**: >7/10 soreness, couldn't do 2nd quality session
⚠️ **RHR elevated**: >62 bpm for 2+ consecutive days
⚠️ **Couldn't extend**: Had to cut reps or duration significantly

**Wenn 2+ yellow lights** → W06 repeat W05 structure (5x + 6x 2min again)

### Red Lights (Back to Shorter Intervals)

🚨 **<4 runs completed**: Couldn't manage volume + 2 quality
🚨 **Extreme fatigue**: Can't complete recovery runs
🚨 **RHR elevated**: >64 bpm persistent
🚨 **HRV crashed**: <35ms all week
🚨 **Interval failure**: Couldn't sustain 2min efforts (HR <150 or legs failing)
🚨 **Injury from intervals**: Muscle strain, tendon issue

**Wenn 1+ red lights** → W06 drop to 1 quality session OR return to 90sec intervals

## Coach's Notes - AGGRESSIVE EXTENSION

**Extending to 2min: Why Now?** ⚡

### Progressive Loading Success

**W04 Achievements**:
- Completed Mon intervals (4x 90sec)
- Managed distributed quality (Mon + Wed structure)
- Volume pushed to 180min+
- Recovery effective (Tue/Wed easy runs)
- **User feels good** = subjective readiness!

**W05 Extension Rationale**:
- Proven we can handle 2 quality sessions per week
- 90sec intervals completed successfully
- Time to extend duration for threshold development
- 8 weeks to race = need threshold endurance NOW

### Why 2min Intervals Matter

**Physiological Benefits**:
- **Threshold development**: 2min @ Z4 = sustained threshold stimulus
- **Race-specific**: Trail racing requires extended efforts on climbs
- **Progressive loading**: 90sec → 2min → 3min → tempo = logical progression
- **Time @ intensity**: 22min total @ Z4 vs 13.5min (W04) = significant stimulus

**What 2min Intervals Build**:
- Lactate clearance capacity
- Sustained power output
- Mental toughness for longer efforts
- Race-specific fitness (trail hills = 2-5min sustained)

### Risk Management

**Monitoring Points**:
- **HR response**: MUST hit 155+ bpm (ideally 160-167)
- **Form degradation**: Watch for form breakdown in later reps
- **Recovery**: RHR Thu morning critical (post-Wed 6x 2min)
- **DOMS**: Expect 4-6/10 (manageable), >7/10 = too much
- **Subjective feel**: "Controlled hard" not "dying"

**Bailout Protocols**:
- Mon: If can't hit 155+ bpm → cut to 4 reps or back to 90sec
- Wed: If legs failing → stop at 4-5 reps, don't force all 6
- Thu: If RHR >62 or DOMS >7 → rest instead of recovery run
- Weekend: If extreme fatigue → reduce to 30-35min or rest

### Volume + Quality Balance

**W05 Weekly Load**:
- Quality: 22min @ Z4 (11x 2min intervals)
- Volume: 155-170min (5 runs)
- Longest run: 45-50min (extended from W04)
- Strength: 2x 30min (flexible timing)
- **Total stress**: High but manageable if recovery works

**Why This Works**:
- Recovery runs (Tue/Thu) = active flushing between quality
- Friday rest = full recovery day
- Strength flexible = can adjust based on fatigue
- Weekend run = proof of recovery effectiveness

### Timeline to Race - 8 Weeks

**W05 (diese Woche)**: Extend intervals (2min threshold)
**W06 (Feb 3+)**: Race-specific tempo (20-25min sustained)
**W07-08 (Feb 10-23)**: Long threshold work (3-5min reps, long efforts)
**W09-11 (Feb 24-Mar 16)**: Trail-specific (long runs, vertical, sustained hills)
**W12 (Mar 17+)**: Taper
**W13 (Mar 22)**: RACE!

**8 weeks = TIGHT but DOABLE**:
- 3 weeks threshold development (W05-07)
- 3 weeks trail-specific (W09-11)
- 1 week tempo transition (W08)
- 1 week taper (W12)

### User Context: "Feels Good"

**Green Lights**:
- Subjective readiness = powerful indicator
- W04 success = proven capacity
- Aggressive timeline = justifies pushing
- **Trust the athlete's self-assessment!**

**But Monitor Closely**:
- Feeling good ≠ ignore recovery metrics
- RHR/HRV still critical
- One bad night sleep = adjust plan
- DOMS >7/10 = back off immediately

### Strength Training Flexibility

**Why Flexible Timing**:
- 2x quality runs = high load
- Strength can be adjusted without compromising running
- Options: Mon+Wed, Mon+Thu, Wed+Sa, Thu+Sa
- **Priority**: Running quality > strength timing

**Leg Power Still Critical**:
- Trail racing = leg strength sport
- Vertical climbing = power demands
- 2x per week NON-NEGOTIABLE (even if timing flexible)
- Focus: Explosive work (jump squats) + stability (single-leg)

## Heart Rate Zone Quick Reference

**Diese Woche Z1 + Z4**:
- **Z1**: 120-146 bpm (TARGET: 130-145 bpm for easy runs, 120-140 for recovery)
- **Z4**: 160-167 bpm (threshold intervals)

**Week 05 Zone Distribution**:
- 85% @ Z1 (easy/recovery running + warmup/cooldown)
- 15% @ Z4 (11x 2min intervals = ~22min @ threshold)
- **Key**: High quality volume, high easy volume, proper recovery

---

## Week 06 Preview

*Assuming successful Week 05 (both quality sessions + 155min+ volume):*

**Race-Specific Tempo Work** 🔥:
- **Wed**: Tempo run 20-25min @ Z3-Z4 (sustained threshold)
- **Mon**: Hill intervals 4-5x 3min @ Z4 (extend duration)
- **Tue + Thu**: Easy runs 35-40min @ Z1
- **Weekend**: Easy 50min mandatory
- **Total**: 160-175min
- **Strength**: 2x 30min (continue leg power focus)

**Goals**:
- Apply threshold fitness to race-specific scenarios
- Sustained tempo work (20-25min continuous)
- Build toward trail-specific long efforts
- Prove threshold capacity translates to sustained running

**Focus**:
- Tempo endurance (not intervals anymore)
- Volume consistency (5 runs mandatory)
- Transition to race-specific work

*Wenn W05 schwierig war: Repeat W05 structure (5x + 6x 2min again) in W06!*
