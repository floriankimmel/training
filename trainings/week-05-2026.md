# Week 05, 2026 - EXTEND INTERVALS TO 2MIN

## Post-Corona Phase 5: Interval Progression

**Race**: Lindkogel Trail 2026 (March 22, 2026) - 34km mit 1000m+ elevation
**Weeks Until Race**: 8 Wochen
**Phase**: Post-Corona Recovery - Interval Extension Phase
**Current Week**: January 25-31, 2026

## Week 04 Analysis - CRITICAL ASSESSMENT NEEDED! ⚠️

**Today is Friday Jan 23, 2026** - Week 04 is still ongoing!

**Sessions Completed So Far**:
- Mo 20.01: Hill Intervals 4x 90sec planned
- Di 21.01: Recovery run planned
- Mi 22.01: Hill Intervals 5x 90sec (main session) planned
- Do 23.01: Recovery run planned (TODAY)
- Fr 24.01: Rest day planned
- Su 26.01: Easy run planned

**W04 Status**: IN PROGRESS - awaiting completion data

**Recovery Metrics - W04 (Last 4 Days)**:

| Date | HRV (SDNN) | RHR | Sleep | Next-Day | Assessment |
|------|-----------|-----|-------|----------|------------|
| Jan 20 | 42.36ms ✅ | - | 445min ✅ | Mo intervals | Ready |
| Jan 21 | 34.91ms ⚠️ | 62 ⚠️ | 405min ⚠️ | Di recovery | Moderate drop |
| Jan 22 | 41.23ms ✅ | 60 ⚠️ | 436min ✅ | Mi intervals | Rebounded! |
| Jan 23 (TODAY) | - | - | - | Do recovery | - |

**Recovery Pattern Shows**:
- **HRV**: Dropped Mon→Tue (42→35ms) but rebounded to 41ms Wednesday
- **RHR**: Elevated 60-62 bpm (above baseline 54-57)
- **Sleep**: Good duration 405-445min (6.7-7.4h)
- **Verdict**: Body showing stress but recovering session-to-session

**Key Questions for W05 Planning**:
1. **Did you complete BOTH interval sessions** (Mon 4x + Wed 5x 90sec)?
2. **What was your HR response** during intervals (did you hit 160+ bpm)?
3. **How did your legs feel** - could they sustain the efforts or failing like W03?
4. **Total volume** - did you complete all 5 runs (Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Sun)?
5. **Recovery feeling** - are you managing the 2 quality + recovery structure?

---

## Week 05 Training Philosophy - TWO PATHS POSSIBLE

**CRITICAL**: This plan has **TWO VERSIONS** depending on W04 outcome!

### Path A: Interval Extension (If W04 Successful) 🔥

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ BOTH interval sessions completed (Mon 4x + Wed 5x 90sec)
- ✅ HR hit 160+ bpm on majority of intervals
- ✅ Legs sustained efforts (not failing mid-interval)
- ✅ 5 runs completed (145-155min total)
- ✅ Recovery managed (RHR <62 bpm, feeling OK)

**W05 Strategy (Path A)**:
- Volume: 150-165min (5 runs) - slight increase
- Quality: 2x interval sessions (Mon 5x 2min + Wed 6x 2min) @ Z4
- Recovery: Tue + Thu @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
- Rest: Friday
- Easy run: Sunday (45-50min)
- Strength: 2x 30min (Mon + Wed evenings)

**Key Progression**:
- **Extend duration**: 90sec → 2min (33% longer)
- **More reps**: Mon 5x (vs 4x) + Wed 6x (vs 5x)
- **Slightly higher volume**: 150-165min vs 145-155min
- **Same structure**: Mon/Wed quality, Tue/Thu recovery

---

### Path B: Consolidate 90sec Intervals (If W04 Struggled) ⚠️

**Indicators You Need Path B**:
- ❌ Only 1 interval session completed (or neither)
- ❌ HR stayed <155 bpm on multiple intervals (legs failing)
- ❌ Couldn't complete all 5 runs
- ❌ Recovery poor (RHR >62, extreme fatigue)
- ❌ Feeling overwhelmed by 2 quality sessions/week

**W05 Strategy (Path B)**:
- Volume: 135-145min (4-5 runs) - hold or slight reduction
- Quality: 2x interval sessions BUT keep 90sec (Mon 5x + Wed 6x 90sec)
- Recovery: Tue + Thu @ Z1
- Rest: Friday
- Easy run: Sunday (40-45min)
- Strength: 1-2x 30min (prioritize recovery)

**Key Approach**:
- **Hold duration**: Stay at 90sec (don't extend yet)
- **Add reps**: 5x + 6x (build volume at current duration)
- **Same volume**: 135-145min (don't increase)
- **Prove mastery**: Show you can handle 90sec consistently

---

## ASSUMING PATH A (INTERVAL EXTENSION) - Adjust if Path B needed!

**Priorität**: Extend interval duration to 2min while maintaining quality execution

**Post-Corona Phase 5 Strategy**:
- Volume: 150-165min (5 runs) - MANDATORY
- Quality: 2x interval sessions (Mon 5x 2min + Wed 6x 2min) @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)
- Recovery: Tue + Thu @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
- Rest: Friday
- Easy run: Sunday (45-50min) - longest run of week
- Strength: 2x 30min (Mon + Wed evenings) - LEG POWER FOCUS

**Why 2min Intervals Now** (if W04 succeeded):
- W04 proved: Legs can sustain 90sec threshold efforts
- Next logical step: Extend to 2min (classic Z4 threshold interval)
- More reps: 5+6=11 total intervals vs W04's 4+5=9
- Total quality time: ~22min @ Z4 vs W04's ~13.5min
- Volume increase: 150-165min vs 145-155min (+5-10min)

**Race Timeline Context**:
- **8 weeks to race** = need to build threshold capacity NOW
- W05: 2min intervals (threshold foundation)
- W06: 3min intervals (race-specific)
- W07-08: Long threshold efforts + hills
- W09-10: Trail-specific (long runs, sustained climbing)
- W11: Taper begin
- W12: RACE (March 22)

---

## Saturday, January 25

- **Morning**: Recovery Check (reflecting on W04)
  - **Assess**: How did this week go? Complete 5 runs? Both intervals?
  - **Energy**: 1-10 scale (>7 = good)
  - **Legs**: Fresh or tired from W04?
  - **Decision**: Confirm Path A or Path B for W05
- **Lunch**: **Unscheduled** - Weekend flexibility
- **Evening**: Free

*Rest day - assess W04, prepare for W05*

---

## Sunday, January 26

- **Morning**: **Easy Run** - 45-50min @ Z1 (130-145 bpm) - MANDATORY
  - **Decision criteria** (Path A):
    - Recovered from W04 = GO for 45-50min
    - RHR <60 bpm + legs OK
    - Energy >7/10
  - **Target HR**: 130-145 bpm
  - **Pace**: 5:45-6:15 min/km
  - **Route**: Flat or slightly rolling OK
  - **Mental**: "Longest easy run - end W04 strong, set tone for W05!"
  - **Purpose**: Build volume, aerobic endurance, recovery quality
  - **IF Path B needed**: Reduce to 40-45min
- **Afternoon**: Family priority
- **Focus**: Prep für W05 (big week ahead!)

*Weekend run mandatory - longest run of week*

---

## Monday, January 27

- **Morning**: RHR/Recovery Check - CRITICAL for Path A decision
  - Expected: RHR 55-58 bpm (should be recovered from weekend)
  - HRV: 40+ ms preferred
  - Decision Matrix:
    - RHR <58 bpm + Energy >7/10 + W04 successful = GREEN → Path A (5x 2min)
    - RHR 58-60 bpm OR W04 partial = YELLOW → Path B (5x 90sec)
    - RHR >60 bpm OR W04 failed = RED → Easy run only, reassess
- **Lunch**: **Hill Intervals #1 (PATH A)** - 45min total
  - **Structure**:
    - 15min @ Z1 warmup (130-145 bpm)
    - **5x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)** w/ 3min recovery jog between
    - 10min @ Z1 cool-down
  - **Target HR**: 160-167 bpm (Z4 threshold)
  - **Effort**: RPE 7-8/10 (controlled hard, NOT max)
  - **Key difference from W04**: 2min vs 90sec = 33% longer!
  - **Focus**: Sustain power entire 2min, don't fade in second minute
  - **Recovery**: 3min @ Z1 (130-140 bpm) - longer recovery for longer reps
  - **Bailout**: If HR <155 bpm or legs failing → abort, switch to easy
  - **Purpose**: Extend threshold duration, prove legs ready for 2min
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min
  - Leg power focus (jump squats, Bulgarian splits, single-leg RDL, calf raises)
  - Core work

*NEW: 2min intervals! First test of extended duration*

**IF PATH B**: Same workout BUT 5x 90sec @ Z4 (same as W04 Wed structure)

---

## Tuesday, January 28

- **Morning**: Recovery Check post-Monday intervals
  - **Assess**: How did Mon 2min intervals feel? DOMS? HR response?
  - **RHR**: Should stay <62 bpm (spike = overload)
  - Decision Matrix:
    - RHR <60 bpm + legs OK → 35min recovery
    - RHR 60-62 bpm = YELLOW → 30min easy
    - RHR >62 bpm = RED → Rest day
- **Lunch**: **Recovery Run** - 30-35min @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
  - **Target HR**: 120-140 bpm (EASY recovery!)
  - **Pace**: 6:00-7:00 min/km (slow = correct after 2min intervals!)
  - **Route**: FLAT, familiar
  - **Mental**: "Active recovery post-2min intervals - flush legs"
  - **Success**: Easy feel, HR stable, legs loosening
  - **CRITICAL**: This is RECOVERY, not training! Keep HR <140 bpm!
- **Evening**: Free

*Recovery Day #1 - essential after extending interval duration*

---

## Wednesday, January 29

- **Morning**: Recovery Check - MOST CRITICAL of week!
  - **Essential**: Recovered from Mon 2min intervals?
  - RHR should be <60 bpm, Energy >7/10
  - **Decision**:
    - RHR <58 + legs good + Mon went well = GREEN → 6x 2min as planned
    - RHR 58-60 + legs OK + Mon was hard = YELLOW → 5x 2min (reduce reps)
    - RHR >60 OR legs very tired = RED → Easy run only, NO intervals
- **Lunch**: **Hill Intervals #2 (MAIN SESSION - PATH A)** - 50min total
  - **Structure**:
    - 15min @ Z1 warmup (130-145 bpm)
    - **6x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm)** w/ 3min recovery jog between
    - 10min @ Z1 cool-down
  - **Interval execution**:
    - **Target HR**: 160-167 bpm (Z4 threshold)
    - **Effort**: RPE 7-8/10 (controlled hard, NOT max)
    - **Focus**: Sustained power entire 2min, consistent effort across all 6 reps
    - **Recovery**: 3min @ Z1 (130-140 bpm) between reps - full recovery
    - **Key**: Pace yourself - rep 6 should feel similar to rep 1
    - **Mental cue**: "Smooth, sustained, strong - not sprinting!"
  - **Longer than W04**: 6x 2min = 12min total @ Z4 vs W04's 7.5min
  - **Bailout**: If HR <155 bpm or legs failing → reduce to 4-5 reps, switch to easy if needed
  - **Total duration**: ~50min
  - **Purpose**: MAIN quality session - prove you can handle 2min threshold intervals
- **Evening**: **Strength Training** - 30min
  - **Leg Power Focus**:
    - Jump squats 3x8 (explosive!)
    - Bulgarian split squats 3x10 each leg
    - Single-leg RDL 3x10 each
    - Box step-ups 3x12 each
    - Calf raises 3x15
  - **Core**: Plank variations 3x 45s

*MAIN SESSION: 6x 2min @ Z4 - biggest quality session post-Corona!*

**IF PATH B**: Same workout BUT 6x 90sec @ Z4 (consolidate before extending)

---

## Thursday, January 30

- **Morning**: Recovery Check post-Wed intervals - CRITICAL!
  - **Assess**: How do legs feel? DOMS? Movement quality?
  - **RHR**: MUST be <62 bpm (spike = overload from 2 quality sessions)
  - **Decision**:
    - RHR <60 + legs OK → 35min recovery run
    - RHR 60-62 + legs tired → 25-30min easy
    - RHR >62 OR legs very sore → REST DAY
- **Lunch**: **Recovery Run** - 30-35min @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
  - **Target HR**: 120-140 bpm (EASY recovery!)
  - **Pace**: 6:00-7:00 min/km (slow = correct after 2x 2min sessions!)
  - **Route**: FLAT, familiar
  - **Mental**: "Second recovery day - prepare for weekend"
  - **Success**: Easy feel, HR stable, legs responsive
  - **CRITICAL**: If HR drifting >140 or legs heavy → cut short!
- **Evening**: Free

*Recovery Day #2 - critical after extending intervals to 2min*

---

## Friday, January 31

- **Morning**: Recovery Check
  - **Assess**: How recovered from Mon + Wed 2min intervals?
  - **RHR**: Check trend over week
  - **HRV**: Should be rebounding if recovering well
  - **Energy**: Should be improving after Thu recovery
- **Lunch**: **Rest from running**
  - **Purpose**: Full recovery day post 2 quality sessions
  - **Mental**: "Let legs recover before weekend run"
  - **Active recovery**: Light walk 20-30min optional
- **Evening**: Free

*Rest day - recover from 2 quality + 2 recovery sessions*

---

## Weekend (Saturday Jan 31 - Sunday Feb 1)

### Saturday, February 1

- **Morning**: Recovery Check
  - **Assess**: Week so far? Energy level?
  - **RHR**: Should be returning to baseline 54-58 bpm
  - **HRV**: Rebounding toward 41+ ms
- **Lunch**: **Unscheduled** - Weekend flexibility
- **Evening**: Free

*Rest day - family/life priority*

---

### Sunday, February 1

- **Morning**: **Easy Run** - 45-50min @ Z1 (130-145 bpm) - MANDATORY
  - **Decision criteria**:
    - RHR <60 bpm + recovered = GO for 45-50min
    - RHR 60-62 = reduce to 40-45min
    - RHR >62 OR extreme fatigue = 35min or rest
  - **Target HR**: 130-145 bpm
  - **Pace**: 5:45-6:15 min/km
  - **Route**: Flat or slightly rolling OK
  - **Mental**: "End-of-week run - longest easy run, proving recovery from 2min intervals!"
  - **Purpose**: Complete volume target, show body handling extended intervals + volume
  - **Key**: Should feel EASY - if struggling, 2min was too much too soon
- **Afternoon**: Family priority
- **Focus**: Assess W05 success, prep für W06

*Weekend run mandatory - longest run of week, proves adaptation to 2min intervals*

---

## Backup Options & Flexibility

**Missed Monday**:
- Shift to Tu (then: Tu 5x 2min, We recovery, Th 6x 2min, Fr recovery)
- Or: Skip Mon, focus on We 6x 2min as single quality session

**Missed Wednesday**:
- **WICHTIG**: Main session of week!
- Shift to Do (then: Do 6x 2min, Fr recovery)
- Or: Repeat Mon structure (5x 2min) - don't skip quality!

**Missed Thursday**:
- Not critical (recovery run)
- Mon + We + Fr easy = 3 quality days OK

**Missed Friday**:
- Shift to Sa (Sa lunch possible ausnahmsweise)
- Or: Weekend run becomes #4

**Wenn 2min Intervals zu hart fühlen**:
- Reduce reps: Mon 4x (vs 5x), We 5x (vs 6x)
- Or: Reduce duration: Drop back to 90sec for all reps
- Or: Abort mid-session, switch to easy
- **No panic**: W06 repeat 90sec approach, extend later

**Wenn Legs sehr sore from Mon/We 2min**:
- Th + Fr: Both @ 30min max, HR <140 bpm
- Skip weekend run automatic
- W06: Path B (repeat 90sec intervals, don't extend yet)

## Recovery Protocol - EXTENDED INTERVAL MONITORING

### Daily Morning Checks - ESSENTIAL

**Mon/Tu/We/Fr morgens (vor run decision)**:
1. **RHR**: <58 bpm = GREEN, 58-60 = YELLOW, >60 = RED
2. **Subjektive Energie**: 1-10 Scale (>7 = GREEN)
3. **HRV wenn möglich**: >40 = GREEN, 37-40 = YELLOW, <37 = RED
4. **Sleep letzte Nacht**: >6.5h = GREEN
5. **Legs feel**: Fresh = GREEN, Tired = YELLOW, Sore = RED

**Tu/Th morgen (post-intervals check) - CRITICAL**:
1. **Leg soreness**: 1-10 scale
   - 0-3 = Normal, proceed
   - 4-6 = Reduce to 30min recovery
   - 7-10 = Rest day, 2min too much
2. **Movement quality**: Stiff? Or loose?
3. **RHR**: Should stay <62 bpm (spike = overload)
4. **Energy**: Should recover within 24-48h of quality

### Decision Matrix W05

**GREEN LIGHT (Run as planned - Path A)**:
- RHR <58 bpm
- Energy >7/10
- HRV >40ms (if tracked)
- Sleep >6.5h
- Legs feel fresh
- W04 was successful
- → 2min intervals OK, 35-45min runs

**YELLOW LIGHT (Modify - Path B or reduce)**:
- RHR 58-60 bpm
- Energy 6-7/10
- HRV 37-40ms
- Sleep 6-6.5h
- Legs slightly tired
- W04 was partial success
- → 90sec intervals, 30-35min runs

**RED LIGHT (Very Easy or Rest)**:
- RHR >60 bpm
- Energy <6/10
- HRV <37ms
- Sleep <6h
- Legs sore/heavy (>6/10)
- W04 failed or incomplete
- → Easy only or rest, W06 reassess

### Extended Interval Monitoring

**Post-2min Assessment (Tu/Th mornings)**:
- **Good signs**: Slight muscle awareness, feel "worked" but OK, no excessive stiffness
- **Yellow flags**: DOMS 4-6/10, slower movement, legs tired during recovery runs
- **Red flags**: DOMS >6/10, can't recover between sessions, RHR elevated >24h

**If 2min too hard** (Path B indicators):
- Tu/Th: Can't complete recovery runs comfortably
- RHR stays >60 bpm for 2+ consecutive days
- Energy doesn't rebound by Fri
- Legs feel "dead" during intervals (HR won't rise)
- **W06 plan**: Stay at 90sec, add more reps (6x + 8x 90sec)

---

## Race-Specific Context

**Lindkogel Trail (8 Wochen out)** - Threshold Building Phase:

**Timeline Update**:
- **W01-02** (completed): Test + Restart ✅ PASSED
- **W03** (completed): Quality return attempted ⚠️ (legs not ready)
- **W04** (completed): Neuromuscular activation OR interval return (awaiting data!)
- **W05** (diese Woche): Extend intervals to 2min (Path A) OR consolidate 90sec (Path B)
- **W06** (Feb 3+): Extend to 3min @ Z4 OR continue 2min progression
- **W07-08**: Long threshold work (20-25min sustained @ Z3-Z4)
- **W09-10**: Trail-specific (long runs 60-90min, sustained hills, vertical)
- **W11**: Taper begin
- **W12**: RACE (March 22)

**Why This Timeline Works** (Path A):
- **Phase 3 (W05)**: 2min intervals = classic threshold work
- **Phase 4 (W06)**: 3min intervals = race-specific sustained efforts
- **Phase 5 (W07-08)**: Long threshold + hills = trail prep
- **8 weeks left**: 2 weeks threshold intervals + 2 weeks sustained + 3 trail-specific + 1 taper = PERFECT

**Math Check**:
- Threshold build: 2 weeks (W05-06)
- Quality build: 4-5 weeks (W07-10)
- Taper: 1-2 weeks (W11-12)
- **Total**: 7-9 weeks = we have 8 = RIGHT ON TRACK!

## Week 05 Success Metrics - INTERVAL EXTENSION (PATH A)

**Must-Achieve (Top 3 Priorities)**:

1. **Complete BOTH 2min Interval Sessions (Mon + Wed)**
   - Mon: 5x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
   - Wed: 6x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
   - Hit target HR zone (>155 bpm minimum) on BOTH days
   - Complete majority of reps (8+ of 11 total)
   - **Success = legs can sustain 2min threshold efforts!**

2. **Volume Target (5 Runs MANDATORY)**
   - Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Su all required
   - Recovery runs (Tue/Thu) @ 120-140 bpm strict
   - Easy run (Su) @ 130-145 bpm, 45-50min
   - Friday REST day
   - Total 150-165min volume minimum
   - **Success = volume + extended intervals compatible!**

3. **Recovery Management Between Extended Sessions**

   - RHR stays <62 bpm on Thu morning (post-Wed)
   - Can complete both recovery runs
   - No extreme DOMS (>7/10)
   - Energy rebounds by weekend
   - **Success = body adapting to 2min interval duration!**

**Nice-to-Have**:
- HR hits 160-167 bpm on all 11 total intervals
- 2x strength sessions done (Mon + Wed evenings)
- Sleep 7h+ most nights (5+ nights)
- Both 2min sessions feel "strong" not "struggling"
- Can sustain power entire 2min (not fading second minute)

### Green Lights für W06 (Continue Interval Progression to 3min)

✅ **BOTH 2min sessions completed**: Mon 5x + Wed 6x @ 160-167 bpm
✅ **Recovery managed**: RHR <62 bpm both Tue + Thu mornings
✅ **Volume achieved**: 150-165min total (5 runs)
✅ **HR response good**: Hit 160+ bpm on 8+ of 11 intervals

⚠️ **Volume low**: <145min total or <4 runs
⚠️ **HR below target**: <155 bpm on multiple intervals (legs struggling)
⚠️ **DOMS moderate**: 5-7/10 soreness, difficult to recover
⚠️ **RHR elevated**: >60 bpm for 2+ consecutive days
⚠️ **Fading in reps**: Strong start but dying in second minute

**Wenn 2+ yellow lights** → W06 repeat W05 structure (5x + 6x 2min again)

### Red Lights (Back to 90sec Intervals)

🚨 **<4 runs completed**: Couldn't manage volume + 2 quality
🚨 **Extreme fatigue**: Can't complete recovery runs
🚨 **RHR elevated**: >62 bpm persistent
🚨 **HRV crashed**: <35ms all week
🚨 **Injury from 2min**: Muscle strain, tendon issue
🚨 **Legs failing**: Can't sustain 2min efforts, HR won't rise

**Wenn 1+ red lights** → W06 back to 90sec intervals (Path B approach)

---

## Week 05 Success Metrics - CONSOLIDATION (PATH B)

**Must-Achieve (Top 3 Priorities)**:

1. **Complete BOTH 90sec Interval Sessions with MORE REPS**
   - Mon: 5x 90sec @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
   - Wed: 6x 90sec @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)

## Coach's Notes - TWO-PATH STRATEGY

**Critical Decision Point: W04 Assessment Determines W05 Structure!** ⚡

### The Two-Path Approach

**Why This Matters**:
- W04 was AGGRESSIVE: 2x quality sessions/week restart
- W04 extended reps: 4x + 5x = 9 total 90sec intervals
- W04 high volume: 145-155min target
- **Outcome determines if you're ready for 2min or need consolidation**

**Path A (Interval Extension)**:
- **If W04 successful** → extend to 2min NOW
- Rationale: Legs proved they can handle 90sec, ready for next step
- Progression: 90sec → 2min = 33% duration increase
- Timeline: 8 weeks left = need to progress NOW

**Path B (Consolidation)**:
- **If W04 struggled** → consolidate at 90sec with more reps
- Rationale: Need to master 90sec before extending
- Progression: 4x+5x=9 reps → 5x+6x=11 reps (same duration)
- Timeline: Still OK - can extend W06 after mastering 90sec

### What W04 Should Have Shown (Path A Prerequisites)

**Interval Execution**:
- HR consistently hit 160+ bpm during intervals
- Legs sustained effort entire 90sec (not fading)
- Power output stable across reps (not declining)
- Subjective feel: "Hard but controlled" not "dying"

**Recovery Capacity**:
- Completed both Tue + Thu recovery runs
- RHR stayed <62 bpm on Tu/Thu mornings
- No extreme DOMS (>8/10)
- Energy rebounded by Fri-Sat

**Volume Tolerance**:
- Completed all 5 runs (Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Su)
- Total 145-155min achieved
- Runs felt manageable (not devastated after each)

**Mental Confidence**:
- Feel "worked" but not "destroyed"
- Confident in 2x quality/week structure
- Ready for next challenge (2min)

### If W04 Was Partial Success (Path B Makes Sense)

**Indicators**:
- Completed intervals but HR <155 bpm on some reps
- OR: Only 1 quality session done (skipped Mon or Wed)
- OR: Volume <140min or <4 runs completed
- OR: Recovery difficult (RHR >60 for 2+ days)
- OR: Legs felt "dead" but not injured

**Why Path B Works**:
- More reps at 90sec = build neuromuscular capacity
- Same structure (Mon/Wed quality) = maintain pattern
- Slightly lower volume = allow full recovery
- Master 90sec → THEN extend to 2min W06
- Timeline still OK (extend W06, still 7 weeks to race)

### The 2min Interval Challenge

**Why 2min is Different from 90sec**:
- **Neuromuscular**: Legs must sustain force 33% longer
- **Metabolic**: Lactate accumulation higher in second minute
- **Mental**: Harder to push when fatigue builds
- **Recovery**: Longer efforts = longer recovery needed

**Key Success Factors for 2min**:
1. **Pacing**: DON'T start too fast - sustainable effort entire 2min
2. **Form**: Maintain good posture in second minute (don't collapse)
3. **Mental**: Break into 2x 60sec blocks, stay controlled
4. **Recovery**: Full 3min between reps (vs 2:30min for 90sec)
5. **Bailout**: If dying by rep 3-4, reduce remaining reps or switch to easy

**First-Time 2min Tips**:
- **Mon (5x 2min)**: Conservative test - find the right effort level
- **Rep 1-2**: Should feel "comfortable-hard" (RPE 7/10)
- **Rep 3-4**: Should feel "hard" but sustainable (RPE 7.5/10)
- **Rep 5**: Can push slightly harder (RPE 8/10) but don't die
- **Between reps**: Focus on full recovery - HR down to 130-140
- **Mental cue**: "Smooth and strong, not fast and dying"

**Wed (6x 2min)**: 
- **IF Mon went well**: Execute with confidence
- **IF Mon was hard**: Reduce to 5x 2min (same as Mon)
- **Key**: Rep 6 should feel similar to Rep 1-2 = good pacing
- **Watch**: Don't let HR drift down - sign of fatigue
- **Bailout**: If rep 4-5 falling apart, stop at 5 reps total

### Recovery Between Extended Intervals

**Tuesday (day after Mon 5x 2min)**:
- **Expect**: Legs feel "worked" but not destroyed
- **Normal**: DOMS 3-5/10, movement OK but aware
- **RHR**: May be 58-60 bpm (slightly elevated) - OK if <62
- **Run feel**: Should be able to jog 30-35min @ <140 bpm
- **Red flag**: Can't complete 30min easy OR RHR >62

**Thursday (day after Wed 6x 2min)**:
- **Expect**: More fatigue than Tuesday (2nd quality session)
- **Normal**: DOMS 4-6/10, legs tired but functional
- **RHR**: May be 60-62 bpm - OK if not higher
- **Run feel**: 30min @ <140 bpm, might feel heavy but doable
- **Red flag**: RHR >62 OR can't complete 30min without walking

**Friday (2 days post-Wed)**:
- **Expect**: Recovery progressing, legs loosening
- **RHR**: Should be dropping back toward 56-58 bpm
- **Rest day**: CRITICAL - don't add run "because feeling better"
- **Energy**: Should be rebounding for weekend run

**Sunday (4 days post-Wed)**:
- **Expect**: Mostly recovered, ready for long easy run
- **RHR**: Back to baseline 54-58 bpm
- **Run feel**: Should complete 45-50min @ 130-145 bpm comfortably
- **Success sign**: Run feels EASY, not grinding

### Aggressive Timeline Justification

**8 Wochen bis Lindkogel**:

**Threshold Phase (W05-06)**: 2 weeks
- W05: 2min intervals (Path A) OR consolidate 90sec (Path B)
- W06: 3min intervals (if W05 Path A) OR 2min intervals (if W05 Path B)
- **Goal**: Build Z4 threshold capacity

**Sustained Effort Phase (W07-08)**: 2 weeks
- W07: Long tempo 20-25min @ Z3-Z4
- W08: Hill-specific sustained climbs
- **Goal**: Race-specific threshold endurance

**Trail-Specific Phase (W09-10)**: 2 weeks
- Long runs 60-90min with elevation
- Sustained hill efforts 30-40min
- Vertical accumulation 500-800m
- **Goal**: 34km race-specific preparation

**Taper (W11)**: 1 week
- Volume -40%, maintain 2x short quality
- **Goal**: Fresh for race

**RACE (W12)**: March 22! 🏔️

**Why Path A Timeline Works**:
- 2 weeks threshold intervals (W05-06) = build Z4 foundation
- 4 weeks quality + trail-specific (W07-10) = race prep
- 1 week taper = arrive fresh
- **Total**: 7 weeks training + 1 taper = perfect for 34km trail

**Why Path B Timeline Still OK**:
- 1 week consolidate 90sec (W05)
- 2 weeks threshold 2-3min (W06-07)
- 3 weeks trail-specific (W08-10)
- 1 week taper (W11)
- **Total**: 6 weeks training + 1 taper = still adequate

**Bottom Line**: BOTH paths work if executed well!

### Recovery Metrics - What To Watch

**W05 Expected Patterns (Path A - 2min intervals)**:
- **RHR**: Elevated to 58-62 bpm Tu/Th (post-quality)
- **HRV**: May dip to 35-40ms mid-week (OK if rebounds weekend)
- **Sleep**: 420min+ (7h+) CRITICAL for recovery
- **DOMS**: 4-6/10 normal, >7/10 = too much
- **Energy**: Should rebound within 48h of each quality session

**When To Worry (Path A)**:
- RHR >62 bpm for 2+ days = overload
- HRV <33ms for 3+ days = severe fatigue
- DOMS >8/10 = injury risk or excessive load
- Can't complete recovery runs @ <140 bpm = too much
- Energy stays low entire week = not recovering

**W05 Expected Patterns (Path B - consolidate 90sec)**:
- **RHR**: Mild elevation 56-60 bpm (less than Path A)
- **HRV**: Should stay 38-45ms range
- **DOMS**: 3-5/10 normal
- **Energy**: Good throughout week

### Strength Training Priority! 💪

**2x This Week = NON-NEGOTIABLE (Path A)**:
- Mon evening + Wed evening
- **Why critical**: 2min intervals = MORE leg power demand
- Jump squats = explosive force needed for sustained hills
- Single-leg work = stability for long trail efforts
- Calf raises = push-off power for climbing

**1-2x This Week (Path B)**:
- Mon + maybe Wed evening
- If struggling with recovery, skip Wed strength
- Priority: Recovery > strength (this week)

**Hill racing = leg strength sport**:
- 34km + 1000m elevation = LOTS of vertical force
- Cardio alone won't cut it
- Need: Powerful legs + stable ankles + strong core

### Die Wichtigste Message 💯

**W05 Erfolg = Execute YOUR Path (A or B), not someone else's!**

**Path A Success**:
- 2x 2min interval sessions (Mon 5x + Wed 6x @ 160-167 bpm)
- 5 runs total (150-165min)
- RHR stays <62 bpm
- Energy good by weekend
- Legs sustain 2min efforts

**Path B Success**:
- 2x 90sec interval sessions (Mon 5x + Wed 6x @ 160-167 bpm)
- 4-5 runs total (135-145min)
- Consistent execution all reps
- Ready to extend W06

**BOTH ARE SUCCESS!** Because:
- You assess W04 honestly
- You choose appropriate progression
- You execute YOUR plan well
- You build toward race smart

### Your W04 Honesty = Training Gold Again! 🙏

**Just like W03 feedback was CRITICAL**:
- W03: "Legs were limiting factor" = changed W04 plan
- W04: Your honest assessment = determines W05 path
- This continuous feedback = why training works

**Keep This Communication**:
- Subjective feel during intervals (HR hit? Legs sustain?)
- Recovery quality (morning checks, DOMS, energy)
- Confidence level (ready for more or need consolidation)
- Don't hide struggles = helps planning

### Practical Tips 🎯

**Mon Intervals (5x 2min - Path A)**:
- 15min warmup - START SLOW (critical!)
- Interval execution:
  - **First 30sec**: Ease into effort, find rhythm (don't sprint!)
  - **30sec-90sec**: Settle into sustainable Z4 effort
  - **90sec-2min**: MAINTAIN (don't fade!), strong finish
  - **Target HR**: 160-167 bpm by 60sec mark, hold
  - **If HR <155**: Legs not engaging - abort or reduce remaining reps
  - **Recovery**: FULL 3min @ Z1 jog (130-140 bpm)
- 5 reps: Complete all 5 unless legs failing
- 10min easy cooldown
- **Key difference from 90sec**: Second minute is the test!

**Wed Intervals (6x 2min - Path A)**:
- Same execution as Monday
- **CRITICAL**: IF Monday was very hard, reduce to 5x 2min
- **Focus**: Consistent effort across all 6 reps
- **Mental cue**: "Rep 6 should feel like rep 2" = good pacing
- **Watch**: HR drift downward = fatigue (not just low effort)
- **Bailout**: If rep 4-5 falling apart, stop at 5 total

**Tue/Thu Recovery Runs**:
- **CRITICAL**: HR <140 bpm ENTIRE run
- **Expect**: Legs feel "heavy" but should loosen during run
- **Pace**: 6:00-7:00 min/km (SLOW is correct after 2min!)
- **Purpose**: Active recovery, flush legs, not training
- **Abort if**: HR spiking >145 or legs extremely heavy = need rest

**Sun Easy Run (45-50min)**:
- **Purpose**: Longest run of week, aerobic endurance
- **Feel**: Should be EASY - conversational pace
- **Success sign**: Could continue another 10-15min if needed
- **Red flag**: Struggling to maintain HR <145 = 2min was too much

### Final Call To Action ✅

**Before W05 Starts (This Weekend)**:
1. **Assess W04 honestly**:
   - Both interval sessions done? (Mon 4x + Wed 5x 90sec)
   - HR response good? (160+ on most intervals)
   - Volume achieved? (145-155min, 5 runs)
   - Recovery OK? (RHR <62, feeling manageable)
2. **Choose YOUR path**:
   - Path A if W04 successful
   - Path B if W04 partial or struggled
3. **Commit to your path** - don't second-guess mid-week!

**Diese Woche Must-Do (PATH A)**:
1. Morning checks Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Sun - RHR <62 mandatory!
2. **Mon intervals 5x 2min @ 160-167 bpm** - first 2min test!
3. **Tue recovery run** - flush legs @ 120-140 bpm
4. **Wed intervals 6x 2min @ 160-167 bpm** - main session!
5. **Thu recovery run** - prepare for weekend
6. **Fri REST** - full recovery day
7. **Sun easy run 45-50min** - longest run of week
8. 5 runs total (Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Sun) - ALL MANDATORY
9. Total 150-165min volume
10. 2x strength (Mon + Wed evenings!)
11. Sleep 7h+ (aim 5+ nights @ 420min+)
12. **Pace 2min intervals** - don't start too fast!

**If successful (Path A)** → W06: Mon 4x + Wed 5x 3min
**If partial (Path A)** → W06: repeat Mon 5x + Wed 6x 2min
**If successful (Path B)** → W06: NOW extend to Mon 5x + Wed 6x 2min
**If struggling (either path)** → W06: reassess, maybe single quality session/week

**This Is The Test: Can Legs Sustain 2min Threshold Efforts?** (Path A)
**OR: Can You Master 90sec Before Extending?** (Path B)

**Path A = Aggressive but achievable if W04 went well**
**Path B = Smart consolidation if W04 showed gaps**

**BOTH paths lead to successful race if executed honestly!** ⚠️💪

Let's build that threshold! 🔥
