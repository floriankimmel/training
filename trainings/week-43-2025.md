**Segment 2: 2-5km** (Finding Rhythm)
- Target: 5:35-5:45/km
- HR: Settle into 155-165 bpm (Z3)
- Strategy: Use hills with steady effort, recover on descents
- Focus on sustainable rhythm, not pace

**Segment 3: 5-8km** (Holding Strong)
- Target: 5:30-5:40/km
- HR: 160-170 bpm (Z3-Z4)

- This is where fitness shows - trust your training

**Segment 4: 8-10km** (Closing Strong)
- Target: 5:25-5:35/km (negative split if feeling good)
- HR: Accept 165-175 bpm
- Strategy: Increase effort on final hills, push on descents
- Empty the tank in final kilometer

**Final 160m**:
- All-out effort
- Max HR will be 175-180 bpm - this is fine
- Focus on form even when fatigued

## Course-Specific Strategy

### Terrain Adaptation
- **223m elevation gain**: Expect 30-60 seconds slower per km than flat 10K pace
- **Cross country terrain**: May include grass, dirt paths, trails
- **Rolling hills**: Natural interval structure - use it to your advantage

### Hill Technique
- **Uphill**: Shorter stride, quicker cadence, lean slightly forward
- **Downhill**: Let legs open up, controlled but not braking
- **Focus**: Maintain effort (not pace) on hills - HR will guide you

### Weather Considerations (October in Austria)
- **Temperature**: Likely 8-15¬∞C - ideal racing weather
- **Possibility**: Rain/mud - adjust expectations if conditions are tough
- **Wind**: Check forecast - adjust pacing if windy

## Final Coach Notes

Florian, your Week 42 taper showed excellent fitness retention:
- Hill power of 374W demonstrates your climbing strength is race-ready
- Tempo runs at 163 bpm show your threshold is sharp
- Recovery runs prove you're not fatigued

**Keys to Race Success**:
1. **Start Conservative**: First 2km at 5:50-6:00/km - resist the adrenaline
2. **Trust Your Fitness**: When hills hurt at 5-7km, remember your training
3. **Execute the Plan**: Don't try anything new on race day
4. **Finish Strong**: If you feel good at 8km, that's when you push

**This week's priority is RECOVERY, not fitness**. You cannot gain fitness this week, but you can lose freshness by training too much. Trust that the work is done.

**Race Day Mindset**: You've put in the training. The hill intervals, the tempo runs, the consistent mileage - it's all in the bank. Now you get to go collect on that investment.

Run with confidence. Trust your preparation. Enjoy the race.

Good luck! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞Ô∏è
