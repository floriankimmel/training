- **Heart Rate Focus**: Majority of running time in Z1-Z2 for aerobic base

## Backup Plans

- **Missed lunch run**: Replace with 20 min evening tempo intervals (6x2min @ Z4)
- **Bad weather**: Stair climbing in building (15-20 min at conversation effort)
- **Strength training**: Can combine Tuesday + Thursday into one longer session
- **Time crunch**: Minimum effective dose = Wednesday tempo run only

## Progress Notes

**Building from**: Recent tempo work and consistent training pattern
**Next week focus**: Consider adding interval work or extending one easy run
**Key metric to watch**: Heart rate response in Z3 tempo work - should feel controlled

## Motivation

You're in great shape with excellent consistency! This week maintains your current fitness while adding structure. The tempo work builds on your recent 2x2km sessions, and the easy runs support your strong aerobic base. Remember: consistency over perfection - hit 2 out of 3 runs and you're winning the week.
