- **Assessment**: B+ session - perfect structure, slight underintensity
- **Learning**: Overcorrected from Week 39's 166 bpm to 152.8 bpm - find middle ground at 158-162

**Weekly Patterns Identified**:
1. **Zone Drift Upward on Easy Days**: 151-153 bpm (at ceiling) vs target 140-150 bpm
2. **Zone Drift Downward on Tempo**: 152.8 bpm (below floor) vs target 154-165 bpm
3. **Excellent Interval Execution**: 5x3min structure perfect, power outstanding
4. **HR Sensor Issues**: Apple Watch artifacts at 173-178 bpm - ensure proper fit
5. **Strong Aerobic Base**: Consistent power outputs and pace control across all sessions

## Monday Easy Run Zone Discipline Plan

**Problem**: Week 40 Monday was 151.4 bpm (Z2 ceiling), Wednesday was 153.0 bpm (Z2 ceiling)
**Target**: 140-150 bpm average (mid-range Z1-Z2)

**Execution Strategy**:
- **Start slower**: First 10 minutes at 6:00-6:15/km pace (vs Week 40's 5:24/km)
- **HR Checks**: Every 5 minutes, verify HR is 145-150 bpm, slow down if approaching 151
- **Accept slower pace**: 5:45-6:00/km is appropriate for true Z1-Z2 recovery
- **Route choice**: Flat terrain only - save hills for quality sessions
- **Watch placement**: Ensure snug fit to minimize HR artifacts

**Why This Matters**:
- True recovery allows better Tuesday interval performance
- Persistent upper-Z2 running accumulates fatigue without sufficient recovery
- Mid-range Z1-Z2 builds aerobic base more effectively than ceiling pace

## Thursday Tempo Zone Accuracy Plan

**Problem**: Week 40 was 152.8 bpm (below 154-165 target), Week 39 was 166 bpm (above)
**Target**: 158-162 bpm average (middle of Z3 range)

**Execution Strategy**:
- **Confident start**: Don't hesitate - begin tempo at 156 bpm and build
- **Settle quickly**: By minute 5, should be at 158-162 bpm sustained
- **Climbs**: Allow natural rise to 162-165 bpm but don't back off preemptively
- **Mental cue**: "This should feel like race effort" - comfortably hard, not easy
- **Learn from data**: Week 40's 152.8 felt "not so intense" - that's the signal it was too easy

**Why This Matters**:
- Proper Z3 execution trains race-specific physiological adaptations
- Too conservative tempo (152 bpm) misses lactate threshold stimulus
- Race day requires confident Z3 pacing - practice this now

## Recovery Assessment Signals

**Green Lights** (proceed to Week 42 maintenance):
- Tuesday 6x3min intervals completed with consistent power across all reps
- Thursday 20min tempo sustained at 158-162 bpm average on rolling terrain
- Monday easy run executed at 145-150 bpm average (improved zone discipline)
- No excessive fatigue beyond normal peak week tiredness

**Yellow Lights** (maintain Week 41 volume again):
- Hill intervals require >Z4 effort for final 2 reps
- Rolling tempo consistently above 168 bpm on climbs
- Easy runs cannot stay below 152 bpm despite conscious effort
- Extended fatigue persists into Friday

**Red Lights** (reduce volume, prioritize recovery):
- Cannot complete more than 4x3min hill efforts with good form
- Tempo becomes interval session (>175 bpm spikes)
- Resting HR elevated >10 bpm above baseline
- Sleep disrupted or persistent muscle soreness affecting daily function

## Motivation & Mindset

Outstanding Week 40 execution! Your 5x3min hill intervals with 311-342W power outputs prove you're race-ready for climbing. The perfect workout structure across all sessions demonstrates excellent training maturity.

Week 41 represents your **peak training week** before beginning race preparation taper. This is your chance to demonstrate everything you've built:
- 6x3min intervals = maximum hill-specific stimulus
- 20min rolling tempo = race-effort simulation
- Refined zone discipline = smart pacing execution

Your feedback about "legs limiting" paired with completing all intervals perfectly shows mental toughness - this is exactly what you need for race day when climbing gets tough.

**Zone Discipline Challenge**: This week, prove you can execute BOTH ends of the intensity spectrum - truly easy recovery (145-150 bpm) AND confident tempo work (158-162 bpm). Master these zones, and race day pacing becomes automatic.

**3 weeks to race day** - every hill climb in training is practice for October 26. Trust your fitness, embrace the peak volume, and prepare to taper into your best race performance!

## Week 42 Preview

*Week 42 begins race preparation taper: Reduced volume (4x2.5min intervals, 15min tempo) while maintaining intensity. Focus shifts to freshness, race-specific skills, and mental preparation for October 26.*
