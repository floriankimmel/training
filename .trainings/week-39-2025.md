- **Restart approach**: 70-80% of pre-break volume for smooth re-entry

## Race-Specific Progression Notes

**Returning to October 26 Cross-Country Preparation:**
- **Hill Readiness**: Your strength base maintained during Week 38 provides foundation for immediate terrain work
- **Conservative Volume**: Shorter sessions allow focus on race-specific skills over fitness building
- **Effort-Based Training**: Practicing race strategy of consistent effort across varied terrain
- **Build Timeline**: 5 weeks remaining - perfect time for controlled fitness rebuild

**Key Restart Adaptations:**
- **Volume Caution**: Reduced minutes prevent overreaching after break
- **Quality Focus**: Immediate return to race-specific hill and tempo work
- **Assessment Emphasis**: Each session evaluates readiness for Week 40 progression

## Detailed Workout Execution Guide

**Tuesday Hill Intervals (4x2min uphill @ Z3-Z4):**
- **Week 38 Context**: Missed planned 6x3min session - this is conservative restart
- **Execution Strategy**:
  - First rep: 160-165 bpm (find rhythm after time off)
  - Reps 2-4: 165-172 bpm (build confidence on climbs)
- **Recovery Protocol**: Full walk down hill - don't rush between reps
- **Success Metric**: Can complete all 4 reps with controlled breathing

**Thursday Rolling Tempo (15min @ Z3):**
- **Week 38 Context**: Missed planned 20min rolling tempo - shorter restart version
- **Zone Discipline**: Target 154-165 bpm despite terrain changes
- **Effort Cues**: "Comfortably challenging" breathing, could speak 2-3 words
- **Terrain Strategy**: Use hills to practice race-day effort consistency
- **Success Metric**: Maintains Z3 average despite elevation changes

## Recovery Assessment Signals

**Green Lights** (Week 40 normal progression):
- Tuesday intervals feel controlled throughout 2-minute efforts
- Thursday tempo maintains Z3 range despite terrain
- No excessive fatigue 48hrs post-sessions
- Energy levels return to Week 38 feedback levels ("high energy, light legs")

**Yellow Lights** (Week 40 conservative progression):
- Hill intervals require Z4+ effort to maintain rhythm
- Tempo work consistently above 170 bpm on climbs
- Legs feel heavy during Wednesday easy run
- Recovery takes longer than expected between sessions

**Red Lights** (extend restart phase):
- Cannot complete 2-minute hill efforts at any intensity
- Thursday tempo becomes interval work (>175 bpm spikes)
- Excessive fatigue or soreness persists beyond 48hrs
- Multiple missed sessions due to energy/motivation issues

## Motivation & Mindset

Excellent work maintaining your strength base during a busy week! Your body is well-recovered and ready for a smooth return to structured running. The combination of fresh legs and maintained strength foundation puts you in an ideal position for race-specific hill training.

Week 38's bike ride showed "high energy and light legs" - trust this fitness and approach each session with confidence. Remember: you're not starting over, you're strategically restarting with 5 weeks of focused race preparation ahead. Your consistency with strength training demonstrates the discipline that will carry you successfully through race day.

## Week 40 Preview

*Assuming successful completion of Week 39's restart approach, Week 40 will return to full hill training volume (5-6x3min intervals) and extend tempo work (18-20min), building toward peak race preparation phase in Weeks 40-42.*
