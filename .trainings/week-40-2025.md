## Motivation & Mindset

Your Week 39 restart was textbook perfect! The combination of disciplined easy running, powerful hill intervals, and controlled tempo work demonstrates that your fitness is not only fully restored but potentially stronger than before the break.

The progression to full race-preparation volume is well-earned. Your 322-382W hill power outputs show you're already developing race-winning strength, and the perfect zone discipline across all sessions proves your pacing maturity.

Week 40 represents your entry into peak race preparation. Trust the process, embrace the increased volume, and remember that every hill you conquer in training makes race day's 223m of climbing feel like familiar territory. You're building the engine to excel on October 26!

## Week 41 Preview

*Assuming successful completion of Week 40's full build approach, Week 41 will maintain this volume while adding race-specific elements: 6x3min hill intervals with shorter recoveries, 20-22min rolling tempo with race-pace surges, and integration of cross-country running techniques and trail surface preparation.*
