## Weekly Assessment & Context

**Outstanding Week 41 Breakthrough - GOLDILOCKS WEEK**:
- **Completed**: Tuesday hill intervals (6x3min structure executed, but intensity issues) ⚠️
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Wednesday recovery run (44:08 @ 133.5 bpm - PERFECT Z1-Z2 discipline!) ✓✓✓
- **EXCEPTIONAL**: Thursday rolling tempo (49:13 perfect 3-lap structure @ 161.7 bpm Z3) ✓✓✓
- **Strength**: Maintained functional training routine ✓
- **Feedback**: Mixed - Tuesday struggled with intensity, but Wednesday/Thursday showed breakthrough execution

**Critical Week 41 Performance Analysis**:

**Tuesday Hill Intervals - C+ Grade (Structural Success, Intensity Failure)**:
- **Planned**: 6x3min @ Z3-Z4 (160-172 bpm), 320-350W power on 2-3% hills
- **Executed**: 6x3min structure PERFECT, but intensity dramatically too low
- **HR Analysis**: Only 1 of 6 intervals hit target zone (153-163 bpm avg vs 160-172 target)
  - Interval 1: 159.6 bpm (Z3 lower) - OK start
  - Interval 2: 160.9 bpm (Z3) - Just inside zone
  - Interval 3: 153.1 bpm (Z2!) - CRITICAL DROP to wrong zone entirely
  - Interval 4: 158.6 bpm (Z3 lower) - Better but still below
  - Interval 5: 160.7 bpm (Z3) - Good
  - Interval 6: 162.5 bpm (Z3/Z4) - Only rep hitting target!
- **Power Catastrophe**: 122-141W (61% DROP from Week 40's 311-342W)
  - Week 40 power: 311-342W (race-ready)
  - Week 41 power: 122-141W (walking pace equivalent)
  - **Root Cause**: Wrong terrain - 0m elevation recorded, extremely flat route
- **Cool-down Issue**: 148.8 bpm (should be Z1: 120-146 bpm)
- **Diagnosis**: Chose flat terrain instead of 2-3% hills, making interval structure meaningless for race prep

**Wednesday Recovery Run - A+ BREAKTHROUGH (Dramatic Improvement)**:
- **Planned**: 40min @ Z1-Z2 (120-154 bpm), target 145-150 bpm
- **Executed**: 44:08 @ 133.5 bpm avg, 3:36 min/km pace
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: From Week 40's problematic 151.4 bpm to perfect 133.5 bpm
- **Perfect Discipline**: Max HR only 151 bpm (controlled throughout)
- **Progression**: Better pace (3:36 vs Week 40's 5:24) at LOWER heart rate = fitness gain
- **Assessment**: This is EXACTLY what easy running should look like!

**Thursday Rolling Tempo - A+ EXCEPTIONAL (Perfect Execution)**:
- **Planned**: 50min total (10min warm-up + 20min tempo @ Z3: 158-162 bpm + 20min cool-down)
- **Executed**: 49:13 total - Perfect 3-lap structure:
  - Lap 1 (Warm-up): 12:00 @ 135.6 bpm (perfect Z1)
  - **Lap 2 (Tempo): 20:00 @ 161.7 bpm (PERFECT Z3 execution!)**
  - Lap 3 (Cool-down): 17:24 @ 134.7 bpm (perfect Z1 return)
- **Zone Mastery**: 161.7 bpm is textbook Z3 middle-range (154-165 bpm zone)
- **Progression**: Week 40 was 152.8 bpm (too low) → Week 41 is 161.7 bpm (PERFECT)
- **Rolling Terrain**: 73.3m elevation gain - ideal race simulation
- **Power**: 282.8W in tempo lap shows strong climbing capability
- **Assessment**: This is breakthrough tempo execution after weeks of learning!

**Recovery Status**: Mixed but trending excellent - Tuesday's terrain choice error masked by Wednesday/Thursday breakthroughs

## Technical Notes

**Hill Selection Checklist for Tuesday (Learn from Week 41 Mistake):**
- [ ] Visual inspection: Can you see clear upward gradient for 200-300m?
- [ ] Watch verification: Does elevation reading increase during warm-up test?
- [ ] Effort check: Does 2-minute test climb push HR to 160+ bpm?
- [ ] Power confirmation: Does first interval show >280W average?
- [ ] If ANY check fails: Find steeper hill immediately

**Zone Execution Checklists:**

**Easy Runs (Target: 130-145 bpm like Week 41 Wednesday):**
- [ ] Start 10 bpm BELOW target (125-135 bpm first 5 minutes)
- [ ] HR check every 5 minutes: If >145 bpm, slow pace immediately
- [ ] Pace acceptance: 3:30-4:30 min/km is PERFECT for this intensity
- [ ] Watch placement: Snug fit to avoid HR artifacts
- [ ] Success metric: Average 130-145 bpm, max <152 bpm

**Tempo Work (Target: 158-165 bpm like Week 41 Thursday):**
- [ ] Start at 156-160 bpm (confident entry)
- [ ] Settle at 160-165 bpm by minute 5
- [ ] On climbs: Allow natural rise to 165-168 bpm
- [ ] On flats/descents: Return to 158-162 bpm
- [ ] Mental cue: "Race effort - comfortably hard breathing"
- [ ] Success metric: 158-165 bpm average for tempo block

**Taper Execution Principles:**
- Maintain intensity (keep HR zones exactly as trained)
- Reduce volume (fewer intervals, shorter tempo, less total time)
- Increase rest (longer recovery between efforts, more easy days)
- Trust fitness (no "one more hard session" - adaptation is done)
