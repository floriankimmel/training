## Weekly Targets

- **Total running time**: ~150 minutes (10-minute increase from Week 36)
- **Quality sessions**: 2 (longer intervals + extended tempo)
- **Strength sessions**: 3 completed (70 minutes total)
- **Workout structure**: Focus on lap discipline based on your excellent execution

## Progression Notes

**Building from Week 36 Analysis:**
- **Interval Evolution**: 5x4min (longer) vs 6x3min (more reps) for deeper lactate threshold adaptation
- **Tempo Extension**: 25min vs 20min, but targeting true Z3 instead of your executed Z4 intensity
- **Volume Increase**: 50min easy runs vs 45min, supporting increased quality load
- **Structure Emphasis**: Your lap discipline was perfect - maintain this precision

**Key Technical Adaptations:**
- Longer interval reps require more measured pacing - start conservatively
- Extended tempo demands better fueling and hydration management
- Volume increase necessitates stricter easy pace discipline

## Detailed Workout Analysis Integration

**Tuesday Intervals - Based on 6x3min Analysis:**
- Target: More conservative HR start (160-165 bpm in first minute)
- Execution: Your lap 2-6 HR pattern (166-167 avg) was perfect - replicate this
- Recovery: Your 2:00 recovery timing was ideal - maintain this structure
- Adjustment: If 4-minute intervals feel too long, reduce to 5x3:30min

**Thursday Tempo - Based on 20min Analysis:**
- Target: 154-165 bpm range (vs your executed 169.2 bpm)
- Pacing: Your 12.67 km/h consistency was excellent - aim for similar control
- Duration: 25min vs 20min requires more conservative start than your previous effort
- Fuel: Consider light pre-run snack for longer duration effort

## Next Week Preview

*Week 38 will maintain this structure while potentially adding fartlek variety or hill elements, depending on adaptation to longer interval and tempo durations.*

## Heart Rate Zone Execution Guide

**Tuesday Intervals (5x4min @ Z4):**
- Minutes 1-2: 165-170 bpm (controlled entry)
- Minutes 3-4: 170-174 bpm (steady progression)
- Recovery target: Below 150 bpm before next rep
- Based on your pattern: Expect slight fade in later reps (normal)

**Thursday Tempo (25min @ Z3):**
- Minutes 1-5: 154-160 bpm (conservative build)
- Minutes 6-20: 160-165 bpm (steady state)
- Minutes 21-25: 160-170 bpm (finish strong if feeling good)
- Learn from Week 36: You can handle higher intensity but practice true Z3 discipline

## Motivation

Your Week 36 execution was outstanding! The lap-by-lap analysis shows perfect workout structure discipline and strong fitness adaptation. You're ready for this progression - the longer intervals and tempo will deepen your lactate threshold development while building on your proven ability to execute structured workouts. Trust your pacing, maintain your excellent lap discipline, and remember that consistency in execution is what's driving your rapid improvement.
