# Target Race Information

## Race Details

**Event**: Hauptlauf - Crosslauf und Nordic Walking am Nationalfeiertag  
**Location**: Münichsthal/Pfösing  
**Date**: October 26, 2025 (National Holiday)  
**Distance**: 10.16 km  
**Elevation Gain**: 223 m  
**Race Type**: Cross Country / Trail Running

## Course Profile

- **Terrain**: Rolling hills with mixed surfaces
- **Average Gradient**: ~2.2% overall
- **Challenge Level**: Moderately challenging
- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple hill sections requiring strength endurance
  - Natural interval structure from elevation changes
  - Cross country terrain (potentially trails, grass, varied surfaces)

## Race Strategy Considerations

### Pacing Strategy

- **Start conservative**: Hills will naturally increase effort - avoid going out too fast
- **Use terrain**: Attack hills with steady effort, recover on descents
- **Target zones**: Expect Z3-Z4 during climbs, Z2-Z3 on flats and descents
- **Estimated time**: Add 30-60 seconds per km compared to flat 10K pace due to elevation

### Training Focus Areas

**Strength Endurance (Priority 1)**

- Hill repeats and tempo runs on inclines
- Build power for sustained uphill efforts
- Practice running form on varied terrain

**Lactate Threshold (Priority 2)**

- Z3-Z4 tempo work to handle sustained efforts on hills
- Interval training with varied recovery (simulating race terrain)

**Running Economy (Priority 3)**

- Trail/cross country specific adaptations
- Shorter, faster intervals for turnover
- Form work on uneven surfaces

## Training Plan Integration

### Weekly Structure Adaptations

- **Tuesday intervals**: Include hill intervals or tempo hill segments
- **Thursday tempo**: Incorporate sustained uphill sections when possible
- **Easy runs**: Mix terrain when available to build adaptation

### Specific Workouts

- **Hill repeats**: 6-8x 2-3 minutes uphill at Z4 effort
- **Rolling tempo**: 20-25 minutes on hilly route at Z3 effort
- **Fartlek on hills**: Mix of efforts using natural terrain features

### Taper Strategy (Final 2-3 weeks)

- Maintain hill work but reduce volume
- Focus on race pace efforts on similar terrain
- Practice race day fueling and pacing strategy

## Race Day Preparation

### Equipment

- Trail/cross country shoes for better traction
- Weather-appropriate gear (October conditions)
- Minimal fueling needed for 10K distance

### Warm-up

- Extended warm-up due to hilly course
- Include some hill strides to activate climbing muscles
- Dynamic stretching focusing on hip flexors and calves

### Goals

- **A Goal**: Strong finish with negative split strategy
- **B Goal**: Consistent effort throughout, handle hills well
- **C Goal**: Complete race healthy and learn course for future attempts

## Post-Race Analysis Focus

- Compare heart rate zones to training data
- Assess pacing strategy effectiveness on hills
- Evaluate strength endurance performance
- Plan future hill training based on race feedback
