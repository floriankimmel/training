- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple hill sections requiring strength endurance
  - Natural interval structure from elevation changes
  - Cross country terrain (trails, grass, varied surfaces)
  - Familiar course from 2025 race

## Race Strategy Considerations

### Pacing Strategy

- **Start conservative**: Learn from 2025 experience - avoid early adrenaline rush
- **Use terrain strategically**: Attack hills with controlled power, recover on descents
- **Target zones**: Z3 base effort, Z4 on climbs, recover to Z2 on descents
- **Progressive effort**: Build through race, strongest in final 3km
- **Estimated time**: TBD based on 2025 race results and training progression

### Training Focus Areas

**Hill Strength Endurance (Priority 1)**

- Hill repeats: 6-8 x 2-3 minutes at Z4
- Hill tempo runs: 20-25 minutes on rolling terrain
- Power maintenance on climbs with HR control
- Progressive hill intervals (like your Oct 2025 training)

**Race Pace Threshold (Priority 2)**

- Tempo runs at goal race HR (160-165 bpm range)
- Sustained Z3 efforts on varied terrain
- Race simulation workouts
- Practice progressive pacing

**Running Economy (Priority 3)**

- Form work on varied surfaces
- Cadence optimization for hills
- Efficient uphill and downhill technique
- Cross-country specific adaptations

**Taper Execution (Priority 4)**

- Master the volume reduction while maintaining intensity
- Recovery metrics monitoring (RHR, HRV, sleep)
- Easy run discipline in taper period
- Final sharpness sessions timing and execution

## Training Plan Integration

### Build Phase (July-September 2026)

- Progressive volume build after Vienna Trail recovery
- Hill-specific work: 2x per week
- Long runs with elevation accumulation
- Build aerobic base for fall racing

### Specific Phase (September-October 2026)

- Race-specific hill intervals
- Tempo runs on rolling terrain simulating course
- Perfect the 160-165 bpm race pace feel
- Practice progressive racing efforts

### Taper (Final 2-3 weeks)

- **Week -3**: 4x3min hill intervals maintaining power
- **Week -2**: 3x2min hill intervals with progressive intensity
- **Week -1**: Easy runs with perfect Z1-Z2 discipline + race day prep
- Monitor recovery metrics: RHR target ≤54-55 bpm, HRV increasing trend

## Race Day Preparation

### Equipment

- Trail/cross country shoes with good traction
- Weather-appropriate gear (October conditions)
- GPS watch for HR monitoring (ignore pace, watch HR!)
- Post-race warm layers

### Warm-up (Based on 2025 success)

- 10 minutes easy jogging (120-135 bpm)
- 3-4 x 20-second strides at race pace (160-165 bpm)
- 2-3 x 10-second race intensity bursts (170+ bpm)
- 5 minutes walking + dynamic stretching
- Final mental prep: review HR targets

### Race Execution Strategy

**Km 1-2: Conservative Start (155-160 bpm)**
- Fight race-day adrenaline
- Target pace: TBD based on terrain (WATCH HR, not pace!)
- Let others go - you'll catch them on hills

**Km 3-5: Build to Race Pace (160-165 bpm)**
- Settle into proven race HR zone
- Use hill strength tactically
- Maintain on flats, push on climbs within HR limits

**Km 6-8: Sustained Race Effort (162-167 bpm)**
- Progressive build (like training intervals)
- Stay controlled but aggressive
- Pick off competitors on climbs

**Km 9-10.16: Final Push (165-175+ bpm)**
- Empty the tank
- Use all remaining power on climbs
- Strong finish - leave nothing behind

### Fueling Plan

**Pre-Race (2.5-3 hours before)**:
- Familiar breakfast: toast + honey + banana + coffee
- Target: 60-80g carbs
- Final hydration: 400-500ml

**During Race**:
- No fueling needed for ~55 minute effort
- Small sips at aid station if available
- Focus on pacing and effort

**Post-Race**:
- Recovery nutrition within 30 minutes
- Celebration meal with quality carbs + protein
- Rehydration priority

### Goals

- **A Goal**: Improve on 2025 time (use 2025 result as baseline)
- **B Goal**: Execute perfect race strategy - conservative start, progressive build, strong finish
- **C Goal**: Apply all 2025 lessons, demonstrate training improvements

## Advantages for 2026 Race

**Course Familiarity**:
- Raced in 2025 - know the terrain and challenges
- Understand where hills are and how to pace them
- Mental advantage of knowing what to expect

**Training Progression**:
- Year of development between races
- Trail racing experience from earlier 2026 races
- Refined hill-specific training methods
- Better understanding of taper execution

**Lessons from 2025**:
- Data on what race pace feels like (160-165 bpm)
- Knowledge of how to handle race-day adrenaline
- Experience with cross-country pacing
- Understanding of personal strengths (hill power)

**2026 Race Calendar Context**:
- Comes after Vienna Trail Run (October) - good fitness
- Late season race = full year of training in legs
- Can use earlier races as stepping stones
- Peak fitness timing for fall racing

## Post-Race Analysis Focus

- Compare to 2025 race: time, splits, effort, execution
- Assess training year effectiveness
- HR data analysis: consistency with training
- Hill strength progression year-over-year
- Taper execution quality
- Race strategy improvements implemented
- Set baseline for future years

## Notes

- **2025 Race**: Completed October 26, 2025 (see race predictions and feedback)
- **2026 Race**: Return to same course with year of experience
- This becomes an annual benchmark race
- Great opportunity to measure year-over-year progress
- Course knowledge is significant advantage
- Can reference detailed 2025 race prediction and analysis
