## Course Profile

- **Terrain**: Mountain trail with significant elevation changes
- **Average Gradient**: Variable with steep climbs and technical descents
- **Challenge Level**: Challenging (Super Trail category)
- **Key Features**:
  - Significant elevation gain over 34km
  - Technical trail sections requiring good footing
  - Mountain terrain with varied surfaces
  - Longer endurance requirement compared to 10K races

## Available Race Distances

- Fun Trail - 10 km
- Advanced Trail - 21.5 km
- **Super Trail - 34 km** (Your Target)
- Ultra Trail - 54.5 km

## Race Strategy Considerations

### Pacing Strategy

- **Start conservative**: This is 3x longer than recent 10K races - pacing is critical
- **Energy management**: 34km requires careful fueling and hydration strategy
- **Use terrain**: Hike steep sections if needed, run efficiently on flats and downhills
- **Target zones**: Mostly Z2-Z3 effort with Z4 on manageable climbs
- **Estimated time**: TBD based on training progression and course profile analysis

### Training Focus Areas

**Endurance Base (Priority 1)**

- Build weekly volume progressively to handle 34km distance
- Long runs up to 25-30km in training
- Back-to-back long runs to build fatigue resistance
- Time on feet: practice 3-4 hour efforts

**Hill Strength (Priority 2)**

- Extended hill repeats (5-8 minute climbs)
- Vertical gain training (accumulate 400-600m per session)
- Downhill running technique and quad strength
- Power hiking practice for steep sections

**Trail Adaptations (Priority 3)**

- Technical trail running on varied surfaces
- Ankle stability and proprioception work
- Practice with trail shoes on uneven terrain
- Navigation and trail awareness skills

**Fueling Strategy (Priority 4)**

- Practice race nutrition on long runs
- Gel/food timing every 30-45 minutes
- Hydration strategy for 3-4 hour effort
- Train gut to handle nutrition at race pace

## Training Plan Integration

### Build Phase (Jan-Feb 2026)

- Increase weekly volume to 50-60km
- Long runs: 20-25km with elevation
- Hill work: 2x per week (intervals + tempo)
- Cross-training: Consider trail-specific strength work

### Specific Phase (Feb-Mar 2026)

- Long runs: 25-30km simulating race terrain
- Back-to-back weekends: Long run Saturday + moderate run Sunday
- Race-specific workouts: 20km tempo with hills
- Practice fueling and gear for race day

### Taper (Final 2 weeks)

- Reduce volume by 40-50%
- Maintain some hill intensity but reduce duration
- Focus on recovery and race prep
- Final long run: 15-18km, 2 weeks before race

## Race Day Preparation

### Equipment

- Trail running shoes with good grip (technical terrain)
- Hydration vest or handheld bottles
- Nutrition: 6-8 gels/bars for 34km effort
- Weather-appropriate gear (March conditions in Austria - potentially cold)
- Emergency items: whistle, basic first aid

### Warm-up

- 10-15 minutes easy jogging
- Dynamic stretching for hips, quads, calves
- A few strides to activate race pace feel
- Mental preparation for long effort

### Fueling Plan

**Pre-Race (2-3 hours before)**:
- Familiar carb-focused meal (80-100g carbs)
- Hydration: 400-500ml
- Coffee if part of routine

**During Race**:
- Water at every aid station
- Gel/food every 30-45 minutes (start at 30min mark)
- Target: 60-90g carbs per hour
- Electrolytes if weather is warm

**Post-Race**:
- Recovery drink within 30 minutes
- Full meal within 2 hours
- Rehydration priority

### Goals

- **A Goal**: Strong finish, consistent pacing, enjoy the experience
- **B Goal**: Complete the distance healthy, learn about trail racing
- **C Goal**: Gain experience for future trail races, build confidence

## Key Differences from 10K Racing

- **Duration**: 3-4 hours vs 45-60 minutes - entirely different energy systems
- **Fueling**: Mandatory during race vs optional for 10K
- **Pacing**: Much more conservative start, manage effort over hours
- **Mental**: Need mental strategies for long efforts and potential low points
- **Recovery**: Will require more recovery time post-race

## Post-Race Analysis Focus

- Pacing effectiveness over long distance
- Fueling strategy success (any GI issues?)
- Hill climbing efficiency and technique
- Overall endurance capacity assessment
- Lessons for future trail races

## Notes

- This is your first trail race longer than 10K
- Focus on completion and experience rather than time
- Use this race to assess trail ultra potential
- Registration typically opens several months in advance
- Consider a shorter trail race as preparation if needed
