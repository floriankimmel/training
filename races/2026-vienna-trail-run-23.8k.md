- Medium Trail - 15.1 km
- **Long Trail - 23.8 km** (Your Target)

## Race Strategy Considerations

### Pacing Strategy

- **Start conservative**: 1000m elevation requires careful pacing
- **Manage climbs**: Average ~42m elevation per km - significant climbing
- **Use terrain**: Efficient climbing technique, recover on descents
- **Target zones**: Z2-Z3 for most effort, Z4 on steeper climbs
- **Power hiking**: Consider hiking steep sections to preserve energy
- **Estimated time**: TBD based on training and terrain analysis

### Training Focus Areas

**Hill Endurance (Priority 1)**

- Long runs with significant elevation (aim for 600-800m gain)
- Hill repeats: longer intervals (5-10 minutes)
- Vertical gain accumulation: practice climbing volume
- Downhill running technique to save quads

**Trail Running Skills (Priority 2)**

- Technical trail running on varied surfaces
- Ankle stability and balance work
- Uphill and downhill running form
- Trail-specific agility and footwork

**Aerobic Endurance (Priority 3)**

- Build to 20-25km long runs
- Time on feet: 2.5-3 hour efforts
- Back-to-back training days for fatigue resistance
- Progressive long run build

**Power Hiking (Priority 4)**

- Practice efficient hiking technique on steep climbs
- Learn when to hike vs run based on gradient/effort
- Hip flexor and glute strength for uphill power

## Training Plan Integration

### Build Phase (August-September 2026)

- Increase weekly volume to 45-55km
- Long runs: 18-22km with elevation
- Hill sessions: 2x per week
- Trail running: practice technical terrain

### Specific Phase (September-October 2026)

- Long runs: 20-25km with 600-1000m elevation
- Race-specific workouts: sustained climbs at race effort
- Practice fueling strategy for 2.5-3 hour effort
- Trail running technique refinement

### Taper (Final 2 weeks)

- Reduce volume by 40-50%
- Maintain intensity but shorter durations
- Final elevation work: short hills only
- Focus on recovery and freshness

## Race Day Preparation

### Equipment

- Trail running shoes with good grip and protection
- Hydration: handheld or vest (depends on aid station spacing)
- Nutrition: 4-6 gels/bars for 2.5-3 hour effort
- Weather gear: October can be cool and potentially wet
- Optional: lightweight poles if practiced in training

### Warm-up

- 10-15 minutes easy jogging on flat/gentle terrain
- Dynamic stretching: hips, quads, calves, ankles
- A few short hill strides to activate climbing muscles
- Mental visualization of pacing strategy

### Fueling Plan

**Pre-Race (2-3 hours before)**:
- Carb-focused breakfast (60-80g carbs)
- Hydration: 400-500ml
- Coffee if part of routine

**During Race**:
- Start fueling at 30-40 minute mark
- Gel/food every 35-45 minutes
- Target: 50-70g carbs per hour
- Water at aid stations
- Adjust based on weather and effort

**Post-Race**:
- Recovery nutrition within 30 minutes
- Rehydration priority
- Full meal within 2 hours

### Goals

- **A Goal**: Strong climbing performance, consistent pacing, finish strong
- **B Goal**: Handle 1000m elevation gain efficiently, good fueling execution
- **C Goal**: Complete healthy, enjoy Vienna Woods scenery, learn from experience

## Race Characteristics

- **Local Race**: Close to home in Vienna - familiar area
- **Beautiful Setting**: Vienna Woods offer stunning trail running
- **Good Preparation**: Excellent prep race for longer trail events
- **Timing**: October timing works well after summer base building
- **Elevation Challenge**: 1000m gain is significant - tests climbing fitness

## Training Considerations

- Access to Vienna Woods for training runs
- Can pre-run sections of the course for familiarity
- Build hill-specific fitness progressively
- Consider this as a stepping stone between 10K and 34K trail races

## Post-Race Analysis Focus

- Climbing efficiency and technique
- Fueling strategy effectiveness
- Pacing on varied terrain
- Downhill running and quad durability
- Overall trail endurance capacity
- Comparison to other trail race performances

## Notes

- Date TBD for 2026 - check official website for updates
- Registration typically opens several months in advance
- Earlier registration = cheaper entry fee
- This race could be excellent preparation for longer trail races
- Good test of hill-specific fitness improvements
