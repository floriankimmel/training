# Wolkersdorfer Schlossparklauf 2026

## Race Details

**Event**: Wolkersdorfer Schlossparklauf
**Location**: Wolkersdorf, Nieder√∂sterreich, Austria
**Date**: May 2, 2026 (Friday - likely May Day holiday weekend)
**Distance Options**: 5 km (Hobbylauf) and 10 km (Hauptlauf)
**Elevation Gain**: TBD (likely minimal - park course)
**Race Type**: Road/Park Running
**Website**: https://www.schlossparklauf.at/

## Course Profile

- **Terrain**: Park setting - likely flat to gently rolling
- **Challenge Level**: Moderate (depends on distance chosen)
- **Key Features**:
  - Scenic park course around Wolkersdorf castle area
  - Fast, runnable course (good for speed work)
  - Local community race atmosphere
  - Multiple distance options for different goals

## Race Distance Options

- **Hobbylauf 5K**: Start time 09:00
- **Hauptlauf 10K**: Start time 10:00
- Children's races: Start time 12:30

## Race Strategy Considerations

### Pacing Strategy (10K)

- **Start controlled**: First km slightly slower than goal pace
- **Settle in**: Km 2-8 at steady goal pace
- **Finish strong**: Final 2km push hard
- **Target zones**: Z4-Z5 for 10K effort
- **Park course**: Use flat terrain to maintain consistent pace

### Pacing Strategy (5K)

- **Faster start**: Aggressive but controlled first km
- **Hold effort**: Km 2-4 at threshold effort
- **Sprint finish**: Final km all-out
- **Target zones**: Z5 throughout

### Training Focus Areas

**Lactate Threshold (Priority 1 - for 10K)**

- Tempo runs at goal 10K pace
- Threshold intervals (4-6 x 5min)
- Race pace practice
- Sustained Z4 efforts

**Speed (Priority 1 - for 5K)**

- VO2max intervals
- Short repeats (400-800m)
- Fast finish practice
- Track workouts

**Race Execution (Priority 2)**

- Even pacing practice
- Mental toughness for sustained efforts
- Kick development for strong finish
- Time trial simulations

## Training Plan Integration

### Build Phase (March-April 2026)

- After Lindkogel recovery, transition to speed
- Build threshold and VO2max capacity
- Increase intensity, moderate volume
- Include tempo runs on similar terrain

### Specific Phase (April-May 2026)

- Race-specific workouts (10K pace or 5K pace)
- Time trial simulations
- Sharpening intervals
- Practice goal pace repeatedly

### Taper (Final Week)

- Significant volume reduction
- Maintain sharpness with short, fast work
- 2-3 strides at race pace in final days
- Prioritize freshness

## Race Day Preparation

### Equipment

- Road racing shoes (flat course)
- Minimal racing kit
- Watch/GPS for pacing
- Weather-appropriate gear (May conditions usually mild)

### Warm-up

- 15-20 minutes easy jogging
- Dynamic stretching routine
- Progressive strides: 4-6 x 80-100m
- Final bathroom stop and gear shed
- Mental prep: visualize strong pacing

### Fueling Plan

**Pre-Race (2-3 hours before)**:
- Light carb-focused breakfast
- 60-80g carbs for 10K, 40-60g for 5K
- Coffee if part of routine
- Hydration: 400-500ml

**During Race**:
- No fueling needed (5K or 10K duration)
- Water at aid station if needed (10K only)
- Focus on pacing and effort

**Post-Race**:
- Recovery drink/food within 30 minutes
- Rehydration
- Full meal within 2 hours

### Goals (10K Option)

- **A Goal**: Personal best on flat course, strong execution
- **B Goal**: Even pacing, solid threshold effort
- **C Goal**: Complete healthy, assess 10K fitness level

### Goals (5K Option)

- **A Goal**: Fast time, test speed fitness
- **B Goal**: Strong effort, maintain form throughout
- **C Goal**: Speed workout experience, fun race

## Key Race Characteristics

- **Local Race**: Close to home, easy logistics
- **Fast Course**: Park setting likely flat and fast
- **Good Timing**: Early May = spring fitness peak opportunity
- **Community Event**: Local atmosphere, children's races
- **Distance Choice**: Flexibility to choose 5K or 10K based on goals

## Race Selection Considerations

### Choose 10K if:
- Want to test threshold fitness
- Building toward longer races
- Need longer race-specific work
- Goal is endurance at speed

### Choose 5K if:
- Want pure speed test
- Need sharpening workout
- Coming off heavy training week
- Goal is VO2max development

## Post-Race Analysis Focus

- Pacing execution (even splits?)
- Threshold/VO2max capacity assessment
- Compare to previous 5K/10K times
- Effort sustainability
- Form and efficiency at speed
- Recovery needs for upcoming training

## Notes

- Confirmed date: May 2, 2026 (Friday)
- Registration info on website: www.schlossparklauf.at
- Close proximity to Wolkersdorfer Crosslauf (both in May) - coordinate racing schedule
- Consider which distance serves training goals best
- Can be used as workout vs goal race depending on season periodization
