## 2025-09-29 - üèÉ Wien ‚Ä¢ Endurance Run 45 min
**Feel**: 7/10 (good execution with minor zone drift)
**Energy**: Good (consistent pace with slight fade in middle section)
**Legs**: Good (solid cadence at 88.1 rpm, responsive throughout)
**Effort**: Moderate (higher than planned Z1-Z2, drifted into Z2-Z3)
**Notes**: Monday Progression Easy Run - 45:00 moving time, 8.32km, 151.4 bpm avg HR, 5:24 min/km pace. Planned as Z1-Z2 (120-154 bpm) but executed slightly higher in Z2-Z3 range.

**Detailed Metrics**:
- HR Range: 107-173 bpm (concerning max spike, mostly 130-160 range)
- Pace Stability: Consistent 11.1 km/h average (5:24 min/km)
- Elevation: Minimal rolling terrain (162-164m, 35m total gain)
- Cadence: Excellent 88.1 rpm (efficient turnover)
- Power: Strong 258W average (efficient running economy)
- Calories: High 632 burned over 45:00 (indicates higher intensity than intended)

**Objective Analysis**: B+ session - good volume progression (45min vs Week 39's 40min) but zone discipline needs improvement. Target was Z1-Z2 (120-154 bpm) but executed at 151.4 bpm average with concerning 173 bpm max spike. Pace of 5:24/km is too fast for easy running recovery purpose. Strong aerobic efficiency but indicates incomplete recovery from Week 39 or overeager start to Week 40's increased volume.
