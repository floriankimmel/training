## 🎓 Training Philosophy

### ❤️ Heart Rate Zones

- **Z1 (120-146 bpm)** 🟢 - Recovery and warm-up
- **Z2 (146-154 bpm)** 🔵 - Aerobic base building
- **Z3 (154-165 bpm)** 🟡 - Tempo/threshold work
- **Z4 (165-174 bpm)** 🟠 - Lactate threshold intervals
- **Z5 (174+ bpm)** 🔴 - VO2max intervals

### 📅 Weekly Structure

- 🏃 **3 lunch runs**: 40-50 minutes each
- 💪 **3 strength sessions**: 20-25 minutes functional training
- ⚡ **1-2 quality sessions**: Tempo runs or intervals
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Weekend flexibility**: Family time priority

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. 📱 **Set Up Runalyze**: Create account and sync your running activities
2. 🔌 **Configure MCP Server**: Connect Claude Code to Runalyze API
3. 📊 **Establish Baselines**: Run `/recalculate-baselines` to set recovery metrics
4. 📋 **Review Current Plans**: Check the latest week in `trainings/`
5. ⌚ **Heart Rate Monitor**: Required for zone-based training
6. ⏰ **Schedule Assessment**: Plans assume 60-minute lunch breaks available

## 🔄 Command Workflow

### 📆 Weekly Training Cycle

1. **Monday Morning** 🌅 - Run `/coach` to generate the week's training plan
   - Analyzes last 6 weeks of training plans
   - Reviews recent feedback and subjective experiences
   - Assesses recovery metrics (HRV, RHR, sleep) from Runalyze
   - Creates `trainings/week-XX-YYYY.md` with structured daily workouts

2. **After Each Workout** 🏃‍♂️ - Run `/feedback` with optional personal notes
   - Analyzes detailed lap data from Runalyze
   - Compares actual vs. planned workout execution
   - Stores subjective feedback in `feedback/feedback-XX-YYYY.md`
   - Provides constructive analysis and recommendations

3. **Race Preparation** 🏁 - Run `/race-prediction` 1-2 weeks before race
   - Creates race details in `races/current-race-*.md`
   - Analyzes recent training performance
   - Generates time predictions and pacing strategy
   - Saves prediction to `race-predictions/race-prediction-*-week-*-*.md`

## 🔗 Runalyze Integration

The system analyzes Runalyze data to provide comprehensive insights:

### 📊 Activity Analysis
- 🔢 Detailed lap-by-lap performance breakdown
- ❤️ Heart rate zone adherence for each workout segment
- ⚡ Pace consistency and power output tracking
- ✅ Training structure execution quality

### 💤 Recovery Monitoring
- **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)** 📈 - SDNN measurements to assess recovery status
- **Resting Heart Rate** ❤️ - Daily RHR tracking with personalized baselines
- **Sleep Quality** 😴 - Duration, deep sleep, and REM sleep monitoring
- **Next-day indicators** ⏭️ - Recovery metrics show adaptation to previous day's training

### 📈 Training Progression
- 📋 Compare planned vs. actual workout execution
- 🎯 Track fitness improvements over time
- ⚠️ Identify concerning patterns or trends
- 🔧 Adjust training load based on recovery data

## 🔄 Backup Plans

Each weekly plan includes alternatives for:

- 🌧️ **Weather**: Indoor stair climbing options
- ⏱️ **Time constraints**: Minimum effective dose sessions
- ✈️ **Travel**: Hotel room workouts
- 😴 **Fatigue**: Modified intensity options

## 🚦 Recovery Signals

The system uses both objective metrics and subjective feedback to assess recovery:

### 🟢 Green Lights (Continue as Planned)

**Objective Metrics:**
- ✅ HRV in "Good" baseline range
- ✅ RHR in "Good" baseline range
- ✅ Sleep duration 7+ hours with adequate deep/REM sleep
- ✅ Heart rate recovers to target zones within 60-90 seconds

**Subjective Feedback:**
- 💪 Can hit target paces without excessive strain
- ⚡ Energy levels stable
- 🦵 Legs feel fresh or good

### 🟡 Yellow Lights (Modify but Continue)

**Objective Metrics:**
- ⚠️ HRV in "Moderate" range for 1-2 days
- ⚠️ RHR slightly elevated but stable
- ⚠️ Sleep 6-7 hours or disrupted sleep architecture

**Subjective Feedback:**
- 😓 Intervals feel harder than prescribed effort
- 🥵 Tempo work feels labored
- 😮‍💨 Building fatigue but manageable

### 🔴 Red Lights (Rest/Easy Week)

**Objective Metrics:**
- ❌ HRV in "Low" range for 2+ consecutive days
- ❌ RHR elevated above normal baseline for multiple days
- ❌ Sleep consistently <6 hours or significantly disrupted

**Subjective Feedback:**
- 🚫 Cannot hit zone targets with full effort
- 🥱 Persistent heavy legs or low energy
- ⛔ Multiple missed sessions due to fatigue

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### 🏃‍♂️ Workout Execution
- ⚡ **Interval Execution**: "Comfortably hard" effort sustainable for full duration
- 🎯 **Tempo Pacing**: Controlled effort allowing short phrase conversation
- 🟢 **Recovery Runs**: Truly conversational pace in Z1-Z2
- 💪 **Strength Focus**: Running-specific functional movements

### 📊 Data Analysis
- ⏱️ **Moving Time vs Elapsed Time**: All pace calculations use moving time for accuracy
- 🔢 **Lap Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of workout structure vs. planned execution
- 📉 **Heart Rate Drift**: Track HR changes throughout efforts to assess fatigue
- ⚡ **Power Output**: Analyze running power on climbs and varied terrain (when available)

### 💤 Recovery Metrics Interpretation
- ⏭️ **Next-day principle**: Wednesday metrics reflect Tuesday's workout recovery
- ⚠️ **Single anomalies**: One poor metric day may be environmental/stress-related
- 📈 **Multi-day trends**: 2+ consecutive days of poor metrics warrant training adjustment
- 🔄 **Baseline updates**: Recalculate baselines every 2-4 weeks as fitness changes
