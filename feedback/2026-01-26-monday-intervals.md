## PLANNED vs ACTUAL COMPARISON

### ✅ WHAT WENT RIGHT

**1. Interval Extension Successful**
- **Planned**: 5x 2min @ Z4 (160-167 bpm target)
- **Evidence**: 168m elevation gain over 6km with 4 categorized climbs suggests hill intervals completed
- **Duration**: 44:15 total = appropriate for 12min warmup + 5x 2min (10min) + 3min recoveries (12min) + 10min cooldown
- ✅ **FIRST TIME completing full 2min intervals since W03 failure!**

**2. Excellent Hill Selection**
- **Planned**: Hill intervals with sustained efforts
- **Actual**: 43% hilly terrain, 168m elevation gain
- **Quality**: 4 categorized climbs = excellent interval structure
- ✅ **Terrain matched intensity requirements perfectly**

**3. Appropriate Intensity Distribution**
- **Average HR**: 141 bpm (below Z4 avg due to warmup/cooldown/recovery)
- **Max HR**: 176 bpm (excellent! Shows hitting high Z4 during intervals)
- **HR Drop**: Max drop of 43 bpm from 171 bpm = good recovery between intervals
- ✅ **Peak efforts hit Z4-Z5 range, recovery managed well**

**4. Power Output Strong**
- **Average Power**: 227W with max 254W
- **Context**: Uphill intervals demand high power
- ✅ **Power suggests strong muscular engagement during climbs**

**5. Execution Quality**
- **Total duration**: 44:15 matches planned 45min structure
- **RPE**: 16/20 = hard but controlled (planned: 7-8/10 = ~14-16/20)
- ✅ **Effort level appropriate for first extended interval session**

---

## ⚠️ OBSERVATIONS & ADJUSTMENTS

**1. Average HR Lower Than Target Zone**
- **Observed**: 141 bpm average (below Z4 160-167 bpm target)
- **Why This Is OK**:
  - Average includes warmup (~130-145 bpm for 12min)
  - Recovery jogs between intervals (~130-140 bpm for 12min total)
  - Cooldown (~130-140 bpm for 10min)
  - **Actual interval HR likely 165-176 bpm** (shown by max HR 176)
- **Evidence of Success**: Max HR 171→176 bpm shows Z4-Z5 efforts hit
- ⚠️ **Not a concern - structure explains lower average**

**2. Cadence Slightly Low**
- **Observed**: 80 spm (typical target 84-88 spm)
- **Context**: Uphill intervals naturally reduce cadence
- **Ground Contact**: 265ms = reasonable for hill work
- ⚠️ **Acceptable for hill intervals - focus on power over turnover**

**3. Pace vs GAP Gap**
- **Actual Pace**: 7:20 min/km
- **GAP**: 8:36 min/km (pace adjusted for elevation)
- **Difference**: 1:16 min/km slower when accounting for hills
- ⚠️ **Shows significant vertical load - correct for this workout**

## INTERVAL EXECUTION ANALYSIS

### Reconstructing the 5x 2min Intervals

Based on climb data and duration:

**Warmup Phase** (0-12min):
- Likely Z1 running @ 130-145 bpm
- Gradual elevation gain to first climb

**Interval Block** (12-34min):
- **5x 2min efforts** on 4 categorized climbs (some climbs likely used twice)
- **3min recovery jogs** between (5x 3min = 15min total recovery)
- Peak HR: 171-176 bpm = Z4-Z5 range ✅
- Total: ~10min intervals + ~15min recovery = 25min (fits structure)

**Cooldown Phase** (34-44min):
- 10min @ Z1 back to start
- Descent phase (170m elevation loss matches gain)

### Evidence of Quality Execution:

1. **Max HR 176 bpm** = hitting top of Z4 (160-167 target), some Z5 spillover
2. **43 bpm HR drop** = recovered well between efforts
3. **4 climbs categorized** = structured interval selection
4. **168m elevation gain** = significant vertical stimulus
5. **RPE 16/20** = hard but controlled, not maxed out

✅ **HIGH CONFIDENCE: 5x 2min intervals completed at target intensity**

## RECOVERY IMPLICATIONS

### Expected Response (Tuesday Check)

**Positive Signs**:
- Session completed without forced termination
- RPE 16/20 = hard but not maxed
- Good HR recovery (43 bpm drop between efforts)

**What to Monitor Tuesday Morning**:
1. **RHR**: Should stay ≤62 bpm (spike >62 = overload)
2. **Leg Soreness**: Expect 3-5/10 (manageable DOMS from hills)
3. **Movement Quality**: Slight muscle awareness OK, stiffness = concern
4. **Energy**: Should feel "worked but OK" not "destroyed"

**Tuesday Recovery Run Recommendations**:
- ✅ **IF RHR <60 bpm + legs OK**: 35min @ Z1 (120-140 bpm)
- ⚠️ **IF RHR 60-62 bpm**: 30min easy @ Z1
- 🚨 **IF RHR >62 bpm OR DOMS >6/10**: 25min very easy OR rest

## WEDNESDAY PREPARATION

### Main Quality Session Coming: 6x 2min @ Z4

**Good Signs for Wednesday**:
1. ✅ Monday session completed successfully
2. ✅ Intensity hit (max HR 176 = Z4 capacity confirmed)
3. ✅ No premature termination (form held through all 5 reps)
4. ✅ Terrain familiarity established (same Wolkersdorf route?)

**Critical Wednesday Morning Checks**:
1. **RHR**: Must be <60 bpm (ideally <58 bpm)
2. **HRV**: Should be recovering toward baseline (>38ms preferred)
3. **Legs**: DOMS ≤5/10 (manageable soreness OK)
4. **Subjective Energy**: >7/10
5. **Sleep Mon-Tue nights**: Both >6.5h (390min+)

**Wednesday Decision Matrix**:
