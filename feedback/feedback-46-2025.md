## Session Feedback

## 2025-11-10 - 🏃 Ausdauerlauf
**Feel**: 8/10
**Energy**: Good
**Legs**: Good
**Effort**: Easy-Moderate
**Notes**: Major HR discipline improvement from Week 45! Averaged 146.1 bpm (vs Week 45's 147.8/148 bpm on easy runs). Successfully implemented slower pace strategy (6:08 min/km vs previous 5:19-5:24) to control intensity. Still 1.1 bpm over 145 target but massive progress in right direction.

**Detailed Metrics**:
- HR Range: 97-168 bpm (168 spike likely sensor anomaly), working range 138-146 bpm
- Pace Stability: Very consistent 6:08 min/km average (9.79 km/h), excellent discipline
- Elevation: 26m (flat terrain as planned)
- Cadence: 86.2 rpm (excellent mechanical efficiency maintained)
- Power: 231.3W average (good economy for easy effort)
- Calories: 574 burned over 49:05 moving time
- Distance: 8.01km in target 45-50min window

**Performance vs Plan**: A- grade - Perfect pace discipline implementation, significant HR improvement (-1.7 to -1.9 bpm vs Week 45 easy runs), but still 1.1 bpm over 145 target. Strategy working, need 10-15 sec/km slower on Wed to hit perfect <145 bpm.

**Key Insight**: Mental acceptance of "slow" pace (6:08 vs ego-driven 5:19-5:24) = correct training intensity for 34km trail race base building. 80% of trail training must be Z1-Z2.
